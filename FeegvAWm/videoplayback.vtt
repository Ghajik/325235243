WEBVTT

00:03:08.272 --> 00:03:11.023
Thank you very much
and welcome to To Tell the Truth.

00:03:11.108 --> 00:03:15.528
Our first guest, he's made a career out
of being the most outrageous impostor

00:03:15.612 --> 00:03:19.782
that we've ever come across
on this show. You'll see what I mean.

00:03:19.908 --> 00:03:22.368
Number One,
what is your name, please?

00:03:22.452 --> 00:03:24.453
My name is Frank William Abagnale.

00:03:24.538 --> 00:03:27.957
- Number Two?
- My name is Frank William Abagnale.

00:03:28.125 --> 00:03:31.460
- Number Three?
- My name is Frank William Abagnale.

00:03:31.628 --> 00:03:34.380
From 1964 to 1967,

00:03:34.464 --> 00:03:38.551
I successfully impersonated
an airline pilot for Pan Am Airways,

00:03:38.635 --> 00:03:41.470
and I flew over two million miles
for free.

00:03:41.597 --> 00:03:42.722
During that time,

00:03:42.806 --> 00:03:46.726
I was also the Chief Resident
Pediatrician at a Georgia hospital

00:03:46.810 --> 00:03:50.229
and an Assistant Attorney General
for the State of Louisiana.

00:03:50.314 --> 00:03:51.898
By the time I was caught,

00:03:51.982 --> 00:03:56.402
I was considered the youngest and most
daring con man in U.S. history.

00:03:56.486 --> 00:03:59.655
I had cashed almost $4 million
in fraudulent checks

00:03:59.781 --> 00:04:02.992
in 26 foreign countries and all 50 states.

00:04:03.076 --> 00:04:06.329
And I did it all before my 19th birthday.

00:04:06.663 --> 00:04:09.665
My name is Frank William Abagnale.

00:04:14.171 --> 00:04:16.923
So, for the first time,
he'll have to tell the truth.

00:04:17.007 --> 00:04:19.091
We'll start our questioning with Kitty.

00:04:19.176 --> 00:04:21.928
Thank you. Number One,
why, with all your talent,

00:04:22.012 --> 00:04:24.096
and you're obviously
a very bright fellow,

00:04:24.181 --> 00:04:27.475
why didn't you go in for
a legitimate profession?

00:04:27.684 --> 00:04:29.769
It was a question of dollars and cents.

00:04:29.853 --> 00:04:31.729
When I was a young man,
I needed the money,

00:04:31.813 --> 00:04:34.523
and I thought this list of careers was
the easiest way to get it.

00:04:34.608 --> 00:04:38.444
I see. Number Two,
I find this all very fascinating.

00:04:38.528 --> 00:04:41.155
Who was it that finally caught you?

00:04:42.032 --> 00:04:43.699
His name was Carl Hanratty.

00:04:47.412 --> 00:04:48.746
Hanratty.

00:04:51.708 --> 00:04:53.793
I am.

00:04:54.419 --> 00:04:55.836
Carl Hanratty.

00:04:55.921 --> 00:04:59.507
I represent the F.B.I.
from the United States of America.

00:05:02.052 --> 00:05:05.304
I have orders to see
the American prisoner, Abagnale.

00:05:34.167 --> 00:05:35.668
You sit here.

00:05:36.878 --> 00:05:38.963
You do not open the door.

00:05:40.048 --> 00:05:41.966
You do not pass him

00:05:43.051 --> 00:05:45.302
anything through the hole.

00:05:57.357 --> 00:05:58.566
Aw, Jesus.

00:06:18.962 --> 00:06:21.047
You know,
I've got a little bit of a cold myself.

00:06:22.257 --> 00:06:25.092
Frank, I'm here to read
the articles of extradition

00:06:25.177 --> 00:06:27.970
according to the European Court
for Human Rights.

00:06:28.055 --> 00:06:29.388
"Article One,"

00:06:29.473 --> 00:06:32.767
"extradition shall be granted
in respect of offenses..."

00:06:32.851 --> 00:06:38.314
Help me.

00:06:39.566 --> 00:06:42.026
Frank, stop it.

00:06:42.611 --> 00:06:43.903
Help me.

00:06:45.280 --> 00:06:48.574
You don't think
you're actually going to fool me, do you?

00:06:50.327 --> 00:06:53.496
Sixteen pages to go.
Stay with me. "Article Two",

00:06:53.622 --> 00:06:56.749
"if the request for extradition
includes separate offenses..."

00:06:56.833 --> 00:07:01.003
"...each of which is punishable under
the laws of the requesting party..."

00:07:01.922 --> 00:07:03.522
Frank?

00:07:07.469 --> 00:07:08.844
God damn it!

00:07:08.970 --> 00:07:12.181
Get me a doctor in here!
I need a doctor!

00:07:12.265 --> 00:07:14.266
- Yes.
- Doctor! Now!

00:07:14.351 --> 00:07:16.936
Don't sweat it.
We'll get you right to a doctor.

00:07:21.483 --> 00:07:24.944
If you can hear me, don't worry.
I'll take you home in the morning.

00:07:25.028 --> 00:07:27.196
Home in the morning, Frank.

00:07:30.784 --> 00:07:33.452
- What are you doing?
- Washing off the lice.

00:07:33.537 --> 00:07:36.789
This man has to be on a plane
for America. He has to see a doctor.

00:07:36.873 --> 00:07:38.958
Yes, the doctor comes in tomorrow.

00:07:39.042 --> 00:07:42.378
I've worked too long, too hard,
for you to take this away from me.

00:07:42.462 --> 00:07:45.297
If he dies, I'm holding you responsible.

00:07:58.061 --> 00:07:59.311
Oh, Frank.

00:08:41.855 --> 00:08:43.355
Okay, Carl,

00:08:43.732 --> 00:08:45.274
let's go home.

00:08:46.693 --> 00:08:48.360
The New Rochelle Rotary Club

00:08:48.445 --> 00:08:51.363
has a history that goes back to 1919.

00:08:52.073 --> 00:08:53.866
In all those years,

00:08:53.950 --> 00:08:57.369
we've only seen a handful
of deserving gentlemen

00:08:57.454 --> 00:08:59.747
inducted as lifetime members.

00:09:00.540 --> 00:09:04.710
It's an honor that has seen 57 names

00:09:04.920 --> 00:09:06.962
enshrined on the wall of honor.

00:09:07.088 --> 00:09:09.256
And tonight, we make it 58.

00:09:10.091 --> 00:09:11.800
So please stand

00:09:11.968 --> 00:09:16.430
as I present my very good friend,
a man who keeps our pencils sharp

00:09:16.932 --> 00:09:18.766
and our pens in ink.

00:09:18.892 --> 00:09:21.477
Frank William Abagnale.

00:09:40.830 --> 00:09:42.915
I stand here, humbled

00:09:43.667 --> 00:09:46.585
by the presence of
Mayor Robert Wagner

00:09:50.632 --> 00:09:53.968
and our club president, Jack Barnes.

00:09:58.807 --> 00:10:02.434
Most of all, I'm honored to see
my loving wife, Paula

00:10:05.355 --> 00:10:08.190
and my son, Frank, Jr.

00:10:08.358 --> 00:10:09.692
Come on.

00:10:15.532 --> 00:10:17.783
Sitting in the front row.

00:10:22.372 --> 00:10:26.041
Two little mice fell in a bucket of cream.

00:10:26.876 --> 00:10:30.671
The first mouse quickly gave up
and drowned.

00:10:31.548 --> 00:10:33.382
The second mouse

00:10:34.134 --> 00:10:35.301
wouldn't quit.

00:10:35.385 --> 00:10:37.678
He struggled so hard

00:10:37.804 --> 00:10:40.973
that eventually he churned that cream
into butter

00:10:41.141 --> 00:10:42.808
and crawled out.

00:10:43.226 --> 00:10:47.062
Gentlemen, as of this moment,
I am that second mouse.

00:11:04.831 --> 00:11:07.166
You're a better dancer
than your father.

00:11:07.250 --> 00:11:09.084
- Hear that, Daddy?
- Like fun.

00:11:09.210 --> 00:11:10.627
The girls don't know
what they're in for.

00:11:11.880 --> 00:11:13.964
Show him the dance you were doing
when we met.

00:11:14.049 --> 00:11:15.758
Oh, who can remember?

00:11:15.925 --> 00:11:20.346
The people in that little French village
were so happy to see Americans,

00:11:20.430 --> 00:11:23.015
they decided to put on a show for us.

00:11:23.099 --> 00:11:26.852
- So they crammed 200 soldiers...
- We know the story, Daddy.

00:11:26.936 --> 00:11:29.021
Into that tiny social hall,

00:11:29.105 --> 00:11:32.191
and the first person to walk on stage
is your mother

00:11:32.275 --> 00:11:34.276
and she starts to dance.

00:11:34.611 --> 00:11:36.945
You know, it had been months

00:11:37.030 --> 00:11:40.699
since we'd seen a woman,
and here's this blond angel.

00:11:40.784 --> 00:11:42.534
Blond bombshell.

00:11:44.579 --> 00:11:47.456
And the men
are literally holding their breath.

00:11:47.582 --> 00:11:50.584
Holding their breath for you. Hear that?

00:11:52.295 --> 00:11:54.129
I turned to my buddies and I said...

00:11:54.214 --> 00:11:56.799
"I will not leave France without her."

00:11:56.925 --> 00:11:58.384
And I didn't.

00:11:58.468 --> 00:11:59.927
You didn't.

00:12:00.637 --> 00:12:01.970
I didn't.

00:12:02.472 --> 00:12:04.765
Oh, shit, the rug.

00:12:05.308 --> 00:12:06.975
- Oh, Mom.
- I can't believe I...

00:12:07.102 --> 00:12:08.060
It's nothing.

00:12:08.144 --> 00:12:10.396
- Frankie, run and get a towel.
- Yeah.

00:12:10.480 --> 00:12:11.772
Come on.

00:12:16.653 --> 00:12:18.487
Dance with me, Paula.

00:12:29.290 --> 00:12:32.292
Whenever I dance for you,
I get in trouble.

00:12:42.929 --> 00:12:44.346
Oh!

00:12:46.141 --> 00:12:48.600
Frank. Wake up. Come on, let's go.

00:12:48.685 --> 00:12:50.352
Get up, come on.

00:12:50.520 --> 00:12:53.272
- Frank, wake up.
- Dad.

00:12:53.523 --> 00:12:55.941
You don't have to go to school today.
It's okay.

00:12:56.025 --> 00:12:59.194
- Why? Is it snowing?
- Do you have a black suit?

00:12:59.362 --> 00:13:01.363
I overslept again.

00:13:01.489 --> 00:13:04.700
We have a very important meeting
in the city. Eat that.

00:13:04.784 --> 00:13:06.034
Come on.

00:13:06.202 --> 00:13:08.787
Ma'am, open up, please.
It's important.

00:13:08.872 --> 00:13:11.457
What? Oh, gosh.

00:13:11.624 --> 00:13:15.461
- We don't open for half an hour.
- Just open the door. It's important.

00:13:15.545 --> 00:13:17.796
I'm sorry, we don't open for half an hour.

00:13:17.881 --> 00:13:19.465
What's your name, ma'am?

00:13:19.549 --> 00:13:22.134
- Darcy.
- Darcy. That's a pretty name.

00:13:22.218 --> 00:13:25.554
I'm in a fix. I need a suit for my kid.
This is my son, Frank.

00:13:25.680 --> 00:13:27.306
He needs a black suit.

00:13:27.390 --> 00:13:31.727
There was a death in the family.
My father, 85 years old, war hero.

00:13:32.145 --> 00:13:34.980
There's a funeral this afternoon,
military funeral,

00:13:35.064 --> 00:13:38.150
planes flying overhead, 21 -gun salute.

00:13:38.401 --> 00:13:41.487
Frank needs to borrow a suit
for a couple of hours.

00:13:41.571 --> 00:13:44.239
I'm sorry,
we don't loan suits and we're not open.

00:13:44.365 --> 00:13:46.658
Darcy, please. Come back.

00:13:47.994 --> 00:13:50.537
Darcy, is this yours?

00:13:56.085 --> 00:13:58.712
I just found it in the parking lot.

00:13:59.214 --> 00:14:00.464
Uh-huh.

00:14:01.090 --> 00:14:03.884
Must have slipped right off your neck.

00:14:06.429 --> 00:14:08.263
Don't hit the curb.

00:14:12.936 --> 00:14:16.647
Now get out, walk around the back
and hold the door open for me.

00:14:28.034 --> 00:14:30.118
- What's next?
- Okay. Stop grinning.

00:14:30.245 --> 00:14:33.372
When I get inside,
go back to the front seat and wait.

00:14:33.456 --> 00:14:35.707
Even if a cop comes
and writes you a ticket,

00:14:35.792 --> 00:14:37.876
don't move the car, understood?

00:14:37.961 --> 00:14:39.711
Dad, what's all this for?

00:14:39.796 --> 00:14:41.922
You know why the Yankees always win?

00:14:42.632 --> 00:14:43.715
Because they have Mickey Mantle?

00:14:43.800 --> 00:14:47.719
No, it's because the other teams can't
stop staring at those damn pinstripes.

00:14:47.804 --> 00:14:51.306
Watch this. The manager
of Chase Manhattan Bank

00:14:51.891 --> 00:14:54.810
is about to open the door for your father.

00:14:56.896 --> 00:14:58.480
Mr. Abagnale,

00:14:59.148 --> 00:15:01.233
we don't usually loan money to people

00:15:01.317 --> 00:15:03.902
who have unresolved business
with the IRS.

00:15:03.987 --> 00:15:07.155
That's a misunderstanding.
I hired the wrong guy to do my books.

00:15:07.282 --> 00:15:09.491
A mistake anybody could make.

00:15:09.576 --> 00:15:12.327
I just need you guys
to help me weather the storm.

00:15:12.453 --> 00:15:15.330
You're being investigated
by the government for tax fraud.

00:15:15.456 --> 00:15:17.916
My store is
a landmark in New Rochelle.

00:15:18.001 --> 00:15:20.168
I have customers all over New York.

00:15:20.503 --> 00:15:22.379
You're not a customer
at Chase Manhattan.

00:15:22.463 --> 00:15:23.589
We don't know you.

00:15:23.673 --> 00:15:26.675
I'm sure your bank in New Rochelle
could help you out.

00:15:26.759 --> 00:15:28.343
My bank went out of business.

00:15:28.428 --> 00:15:30.679
Banks like this one
put them out of business.

00:15:30.763 --> 00:15:35.100
I know I made a mistake, I admit that.
But these people want blood.

00:15:35.184 --> 00:15:38.979
They want my store.
They've threatened to put me in jail.

00:15:40.189 --> 00:15:42.858
This is America, right?
I'm not a criminal.

00:15:42.942 --> 00:15:46.528
I'm a Medal of Honor winner. A member
of the New Rochelle Rotary Club.

00:15:46.654 --> 00:15:50.157
All I'm asking is
for you to help me beat these guys.

00:15:50.366 --> 00:15:53.869
It's not a question of winning and losing,
it's a question of risk.

00:15:54.871 --> 00:15:58.373
You're the largest bank in the world.
Where's the...

00:15:59.334 --> 00:16:01.043
Where's the risk?

00:16:06.466 --> 00:16:08.717
How could you let him
take our car like that?

00:16:08.843 --> 00:16:12.638
He didn't take anything, we took him.
He overpaid by 500.

00:16:13.222 --> 00:16:16.391
Come on, Frank. Let's return the suit.

00:16:25.360 --> 00:16:26.818
This place is good.

00:16:26.903 --> 00:16:30.072
It's small, but it's gonna be
a lot less work.

00:16:30.740 --> 00:16:32.783
A lot less work for you.

00:16:55.807 --> 00:16:57.140
Hey, Dad.

00:16:58.017 --> 00:16:59.101
Hi.

00:17:03.022 --> 00:17:04.648
Where is your mother?

00:17:05.858 --> 00:17:07.359
I don't know.

00:17:07.819 --> 00:17:11.113
She said something
about going to look for a job.

00:17:12.156 --> 00:17:15.701
What's she going to be,
a shoe salesman at a centipede farm?

00:17:21.290 --> 00:17:23.083
What are you doing?

00:17:24.293 --> 00:17:26.253
You want some pancakes?

00:17:26.337 --> 00:17:29.506
For dinner? On my son's 16th birthday?

00:17:29.590 --> 00:17:32.008
We're not going to eat pancakes.

00:17:35.179 --> 00:17:38.098
Why are you looking at me like that?
You thought I forgot?

00:17:38.182 --> 00:17:41.268
- I didn't think you forgot.
- I opened a checking account

00:17:43.229 --> 00:17:46.398
I put $25 in the account
so you can buy whatever you want.

00:17:46.482 --> 00:17:48.650
- Don't tell your mother.
- I won't.

00:17:48.735 --> 00:17:50.193
Thanks, Dad.

00:17:51.612 --> 00:17:53.822
Didn't that bank turn you down
for a loan?

00:17:53.906 --> 00:17:56.199
Yes, they all turned me down.

00:17:56.868 --> 00:17:58.660
Then why you opening
a banking account with them?

00:17:58.745 --> 00:18:01.580
Because one day, you'll want
something from these people.

00:18:01.664 --> 00:18:03.415
A house, a car...

00:18:03.875 --> 00:18:05.917
They have all the money.

00:18:09.839 --> 00:18:12.048
There's 50 checks there, Frank,

00:18:12.133 --> 00:18:14.551
which means, from this day on,

00:18:16.929 --> 00:18:19.181
you're in their little club.

00:18:19.682 --> 00:18:21.767
I'm in their little club.

00:18:22.393 --> 00:18:24.686
You got that, you got it all.

00:18:25.271 --> 00:18:27.189
It's even got my name there.

00:18:29.066 --> 00:18:31.693
- To the moon.
- To the moon.

00:18:32.737 --> 00:18:34.196
To the moon.

00:18:43.247 --> 00:18:45.540
See that? It's just a school.

00:18:46.167 --> 00:18:48.376
No different than Westbourne.

00:18:48.461 --> 00:18:51.338
Ma, you said you were going to quit.

00:18:55.009 --> 00:18:58.303
Frankie, you don't have to wear
the uniform here.

00:18:59.430 --> 00:19:02.015
Why don't you take off yourjacket?

00:19:02.350 --> 00:19:03.934
I'm used to it.

00:19:09.440 --> 00:19:10.982
- Excuse me.
- Yes?

00:19:11.067 --> 00:19:12.943
Do you know where room 17,
French is?

00:19:13.027 --> 00:19:14.152
Yeah...

00:19:28.793 --> 00:19:30.502
You selling encyclopedias?

00:19:30.586 --> 00:19:33.171
He looks like a substitute teacher.

00:19:48.896 --> 00:19:50.647
Quiet down, people!

00:19:50.940 --> 00:19:52.983
My name is Mr. Abagnale!

00:19:53.442 --> 00:19:56.695
That's Abagnale, not Abagnolee,

00:19:56.821 --> 00:19:59.698
not Abagnelee, but Abagnale.

00:20:00.825 --> 00:20:05.078
Now, somebody please tell me
where you left off in your textbooks.

00:20:05.788 --> 00:20:07.747
Excuse me, people.
If I need to ask again,

00:20:07.832 --> 00:20:09.165
I'm gonna write up the entire class.

00:20:09.250 --> 00:20:10.917
Take your seats!

00:20:15.548 --> 00:20:17.090
Chapter seven.

00:20:17.174 --> 00:20:19.926
Would you please open your textbooks
to chapter eight

00:20:20.011 --> 00:20:21.928
and we'll get started.

00:20:22.763 --> 00:20:24.681
- Excuse me. What's your name?
- Brad.

00:20:24.765 --> 00:20:26.308
Why don't you get up here

00:20:26.392 --> 00:20:30.145
in front of the class
and read conversation number five?

00:20:44.911 --> 00:20:46.578
They sent for me.

00:20:46.662 --> 00:20:49.539
They said they needed
a sub for Roberta.

00:20:49.707 --> 00:20:52.042
I came all the way from Dixon.

00:20:53.377 --> 00:20:55.378
I always sub for Roberta.

00:20:55.463 --> 00:20:57.672
Excuse me, why aren't you reading?

00:20:59.133 --> 00:21:02.552
I'll never come back
to Bellarmine-Jefferson again!

00:21:02.803 --> 00:21:04.596
You tell them not to call me.

00:21:04.680 --> 00:21:07.057
Do they think it's easy
for a woman my age

00:21:07.141 --> 00:21:10.769
and all the money that it costs to travel?
I tell you, they don't give a damn.

00:21:10.853 --> 00:21:12.437
Mr. and Mrs. Abagnale,

00:21:12.521 --> 00:21:15.315
this is not a question
of your son's attendance.

00:21:15.399 --> 00:21:18.401
I regret to inform you
that for the past week,

00:21:18.486 --> 00:21:22.072
Frank has been teaching
Mrs. Glasser's French class.

00:21:23.950 --> 00:21:25.241
He what?

00:21:25.701 --> 00:21:29.496
Your son has been pretending to be
a substitute teacher.

00:21:29.747 --> 00:21:33.166
Lecturing the students,
giving out homework...

00:21:33.668 --> 00:21:35.835
Mrs. Glasser has been ill,

00:21:35.920 --> 00:21:39.089
and there was some confusion
with the real sub.

00:21:40.132 --> 00:21:43.176
Your son held
a teacher-parent conference yesterday

00:21:43.260 --> 00:21:45.595
and was planning a class field trip

00:21:45.680 --> 00:21:48.390
to a French bread factory in Trenton.

00:21:49.433 --> 00:21:51.810
Do you see the problem we have?

00:21:53.688 --> 00:21:57.732
I've a note to miss fifth and sixth period
today. Doctor's appointment.

00:21:57.817 --> 00:22:00.402
One moment. I'll be right with you.

00:22:02.863 --> 00:22:05.281
- You should fold it.
- What?

00:22:05.866 --> 00:22:08.827
That note. It's a fake, right?
You should fold it.

00:22:08.911 --> 00:22:11.705
It's a note from my mom.
I have a doctor's appointment.

00:22:11.789 --> 00:22:14.624
Yeah, but there's no crease
in the paper.

00:22:14.709 --> 00:22:16.543
When your mom hands you a note
to miss school,

00:22:16.627 --> 00:22:20.547
the first thing you do is fold it
and put it in your pocket.

00:22:20.631 --> 00:22:23.133
If it's real, where's the crease?

00:22:32.893 --> 00:22:34.185
Frankie.

00:22:50.077 --> 00:22:51.536
Ma, I'm home.

00:22:54.540 --> 00:22:57.876
Remember that girl Joanna
I was telling you about?

00:22:58.252 --> 00:23:00.170
I asked her out today.

00:23:01.338 --> 00:23:04.340
Think we're going to go
to the junior prom.

00:23:05.134 --> 00:23:07.844
Ma, is this my driver's license?

00:23:07.928 --> 00:23:10.472
That's all there is, two bedrooms.

00:23:10.598 --> 00:23:11.890
Frankie.

00:23:12.016 --> 00:23:14.142
You remember Dad's friend?

00:23:14.560 --> 00:23:16.853
Jack Barnes. From the club.

00:23:17.146 --> 00:23:18.104
Hello.

00:23:18.189 --> 00:23:20.398
He came by looking for your father.

00:23:20.483 --> 00:23:23.026
I was giving him a tour of the apartment.

00:23:23.110 --> 00:23:26.029
It's very spacious, Paula.

00:23:31.827 --> 00:23:33.661
Dad is at the store.

00:23:34.413 --> 00:23:35.872
So, Frank,

00:23:36.749 --> 00:23:40.418
you're getting to look
more like your old man every day.

00:23:42.379 --> 00:23:44.756
Thanks for the sandwich, Paula.

00:23:45.674 --> 00:23:47.801
- I'll see you later.
- Wait.

00:23:53.307 --> 00:23:54.849
Is this yours?

00:23:55.434 --> 00:23:56.476
Oh.

00:23:57.728 --> 00:24:00.688
Thanks, Frank.
That's the President's pin.

00:24:02.066 --> 00:24:04.818
I'd be in deep trouble if I lost that.

00:24:10.574 --> 00:24:12.575
I'll see you all later.

00:24:22.378 --> 00:24:25.713
Are you hungry, Frankie?
I'll make you a sandwich.

00:24:34.682 --> 00:24:37.809
Jack wanted to talk business
with your father.

00:24:39.019 --> 00:24:42.689
He thinks we should get a lawyer
and sue the government.

00:24:43.482 --> 00:24:46.651
That it's not legal,
what they're doing to us.

00:24:49.488 --> 00:24:51.865
Why aren't you saying anything?

00:24:58.122 --> 00:25:01.082
You're not going to tell him, are you?

00:25:02.626 --> 00:25:03.710
No.

00:25:04.587 --> 00:25:07.338
That's right. There's nothing to tell.

00:25:08.591 --> 00:25:13.052
I'm going out for a few hours to visit
some old friends from the tennis club.

00:25:13.137 --> 00:25:16.389
When I get home,
we'll all have dinner together.

00:25:16.724 --> 00:25:17.974
Right?

00:25:18.934 --> 00:25:22.437
But you won't say anything
because it's just silly,

00:25:22.563 --> 00:25:23.897
isn't it?

00:25:24.398 --> 00:25:26.482
How could we sue anybody?

00:25:32.198 --> 00:25:34.616
Do you need some money, Frankie?

00:25:35.034 --> 00:25:38.119
A few dollars to buy
some record albums?

00:25:38.454 --> 00:25:40.580
Here. Take $5.

00:25:42.249 --> 00:25:43.458
Or 10.

00:25:49.340 --> 00:25:51.966
You promised you were going to quit.

00:26:10.986 --> 00:26:12.487
Ma, I'm home.

00:26:27.461 --> 00:26:28.670
Hey, hey!

00:26:28.754 --> 00:26:30.546
You stay away from me. You hear me?

00:26:30.631 --> 00:26:33.341
I don't know who you are,
but if you come back here...

00:26:33.425 --> 00:26:36.427
Frank, calm down, will you?
I'm Dick Keener.

00:26:37.429 --> 00:26:40.890
I want you to leave your things here,
follow me into the next room.

00:26:40.975 --> 00:26:43.518
Okay? They're all waiting for you.

00:26:45.771 --> 00:26:48.398
You don't have to be scared.
I'm right here, Frank.

00:26:48.482 --> 00:26:50.275
I'll always be here.

00:26:50.359 --> 00:26:54.445
But there are laws. Everything in
this country has to be legal.

00:26:54.530 --> 00:26:57.282
So what we need to do
is make some decisions.

00:26:57.366 --> 00:26:58.825
That's what Mr. Keener is here for.

00:26:58.909 --> 00:27:01.619
Many times these decisions
are left up to the courts.

00:27:01.704 --> 00:27:04.747
But that can be very expensive,
people fighting over their children.

00:27:04.832 --> 00:27:06.082
Nobody is fighting.

00:27:06.166 --> 00:27:08.918
Look at me, Frank. Nobody is fighting.

00:27:17.678 --> 00:27:21.597
Do you remember your grandma? Eve?
She arrived this morning.

00:27:21.682 --> 00:27:23.516
Hello.

00:27:32.776 --> 00:27:36.112
Do you understand
what we're saying to you, Frank?

00:27:37.406 --> 00:27:40.658
Your father and I are getting a divorce.

00:27:43.996 --> 00:27:46.706
Nothing's going to change.
We're still gonna see each other.

00:27:46.790 --> 00:27:50.376
- Stop it, please. Don't interrupt.
- You don't have to read all of this.

00:27:50.461 --> 00:27:53.212
Most of it is for your parents,
boring adult business.

00:27:53.297 --> 00:27:55.923
But this paragraph right here,
this is important

00:27:56.008 --> 00:27:59.177
because it states
who you're gonna live with

00:28:00.304 --> 00:28:01.763
after the divorce.

00:28:01.847 --> 00:28:03.723
Whose custody you will be in.

00:28:03.807 --> 00:28:06.434
And there's a blank space right here.

00:28:07.811 --> 00:28:11.147
I want you to go into the kitchen,
sit at the table

00:28:11.231 --> 00:28:12.732
and put a name down.

00:28:12.816 --> 00:28:13.983
You can take as long as you want,

00:28:14.068 --> 00:28:15.610
but when you come back into this room,

00:28:15.694 --> 00:28:18.196
I want to see a name on that line.

00:28:18.280 --> 00:28:22.116
Frank, just write down
a name and this will all be over.

00:28:22.326 --> 00:28:23.868
It's going to be okay.

00:28:23.952 --> 00:28:25.620
Dad, what name?

00:28:25.704 --> 00:28:26.996
Your mother or your father.

00:28:27.081 --> 00:28:29.957
Just put the name there.
It's as simple as that.

00:28:30.042 --> 00:28:33.252
And don't look so scared. It's not a test.

00:28:34.004 --> 00:28:36.089
There's no wrong answer.

00:28:50.771 --> 00:28:52.647
One ticket to Grand Central, please.

00:28:52.731 --> 00:28:54.774
That will be $3.50, sir.

00:28:56.026 --> 00:28:58.569
Is it okay if I write you a check?

00:29:03.784 --> 00:29:06.202
Carl, when do I get to call my father?

00:29:06.578 --> 00:29:09.247
You can call him when we get
to New York.

00:29:09.331 --> 00:29:11.499
We leave for the airport in seven hours.

00:29:12.960 --> 00:29:15.128
Until then, just sit there.

00:29:15.295 --> 00:29:16.629
Be quiet.

00:29:17.714 --> 00:29:21.509
On the other side of the hotel,
they got suites that face the park.

00:29:22.886 --> 00:29:25.638
It's the best room the F.B.I. can afford.

00:29:28.475 --> 00:29:30.893
It's okay, I've stayed in worse.

00:29:31.603 --> 00:29:33.312
Please. You have to listen.

00:29:33.397 --> 00:29:36.732
I don't want to hear your story.
Two checks bounced.

00:29:36.817 --> 00:29:38.609
You know how much trouble I'm in?

00:29:38.694 --> 00:29:41.195
No, but listen. I'm telling you.
The bank, they made the mistake.

00:29:41.280 --> 00:29:42.905
I'll write you another check right now!

00:29:42.990 --> 00:29:45.032
What? Do I look like
I was born yesterday?

00:29:45.117 --> 00:29:47.994
Look, it's midnight.
Where am I going to go?

00:29:48.078 --> 00:29:50.413
You're a goddamn kid. Go home.

00:30:38.629 --> 00:30:42.173
I hope you understand. My boss
sent me to Brooklyn, then Queens.

00:30:42.257 --> 00:30:43.716
Now he wants me in Long Island

00:30:43.800 --> 00:30:46.594
to take a few clients out
for a night on the town.

00:30:46.678 --> 00:30:50.598
I'm sorry, but we're not allowed
to cash checks from other banks.

00:30:50.682 --> 00:30:53.601
- How would we know if they were good?
- What did you say your name was?

00:30:53.685 --> 00:30:55.394
- Ashley.
- Ashley.

00:30:55.479 --> 00:30:58.731
You know what I found
on the sidewalk out there?

00:31:03.654 --> 00:31:06.405
Must have slipped right off your neck.

00:31:10.536 --> 00:31:13.579
Is there something
I can help you with, son?

00:31:13.664 --> 00:31:15.957
It's my grandmother's birthday
next week

00:31:16.041 --> 00:31:18.668
and I want to get her something
extra special.

00:31:18.752 --> 00:31:22.588
Please, it's my midterm next week
and my books were stolen.

00:31:24.341 --> 00:31:27.009
Please, just $5.
No one would have to know.

00:31:27.094 --> 00:31:30.471
I'm sorry,
but we are not allowed to take checks

00:31:30.556 --> 00:31:32.682
from people we don't know.

00:31:55.664 --> 00:31:57.498
Welcome to New York.

00:32:14.224 --> 00:32:16.058
Pleasure to have you back, Captain.

00:32:16.184 --> 00:32:20.271
What do you think, Angelo?
The tomatoes are ripe this afternoon.

00:32:27.571 --> 00:32:28.696
What have we here?

00:32:28.780 --> 00:32:30.865
- Can I have your autograph?
- You betcha.

00:32:30.949 --> 00:32:32.992
- Can I have your autograph, too?
- You gonna be a pilot?

00:32:33.076 --> 00:32:34.368
Mmm-hmm.

00:32:35.037 --> 00:32:36.787
There you go. Work hard in school.

00:32:36.872 --> 00:32:38.205
Dear Dad,

00:32:38.290 --> 00:32:40.791
I've decided to become an airline pilot.

00:32:40.876 --> 00:32:42.710
I've applied to all the big airlines,

00:32:42.794 --> 00:32:45.880
and I have several promising interviews
lined up.

00:32:46.214 --> 00:32:49.050
How is Mom?
Have you called her lately?

00:32:49.134 --> 00:32:51.719
Love, your son, Frank.

00:32:55.390 --> 00:32:56.599
Hello.

00:32:57.392 --> 00:32:59.477
I'm Frank Black
from Murrow High School,

00:32:59.561 --> 00:33:02.271
and I have an appointment
with Mr. Morgan.

00:33:02.397 --> 00:33:05.149
You're the young man who's writing
the article for the school paper.

00:33:05.233 --> 00:33:06.233
Yes, ma'am. That's me.

00:33:06.318 --> 00:33:08.736
I want to know everything there is
to know about being a pilot.

00:33:09.571 --> 00:33:13.074
What airports does Pan Am fly to?
What does a pilot make in a year?

00:33:13.158 --> 00:33:14.867
Who tells them where they're gonna
fly to?

00:33:14.951 --> 00:33:17.161
- Slow down. Take them one at a time.
- All right.

00:33:17.245 --> 00:33:19.997
What does it mean when
one pilot says to another pilot,

00:33:20.082 --> 00:33:21.248
"What kind of equipment are you on?"

00:33:21.333 --> 00:33:25.169
They want to know what aircraft
you're flying. DC-8, 707, Constellation...

00:33:25.253 --> 00:33:28.255
And what about those I.D. badges
that I've seen pilots wear?

00:33:28.340 --> 00:33:30.675
Every pilot must have two things
with him at all times.

00:33:30.759 --> 00:33:34.261
One is his airline personnel badge,
looks just like this one from Pan Am.

00:33:34.346 --> 00:33:36.931
The other one is their FAA license.

00:33:37.182 --> 00:33:39.517
And that looks just like this.

00:33:40.602 --> 00:33:41.727
Oh...

00:33:42.437 --> 00:33:45.064
Do you think I could make a copy
of this to put into my article?

00:33:45.148 --> 00:33:48.275
Frank, you can have that one,
it's three years expired.

00:33:48.360 --> 00:33:50.444
Thanks. And what about
your I.D. badge?

00:33:50.529 --> 00:33:51.821
Do you have an extra one
I could borrow?

00:33:51.947 --> 00:33:53.447
No, I can't help you there.

00:33:53.532 --> 00:33:55.032
Those are special-ordered
from Polaroid.

00:33:55.117 --> 00:33:57.952
The only way to get one
is to become a real live pilot

00:33:58.036 --> 00:33:59.495
for Pan American Airways.

00:34:04.501 --> 00:34:06.210
Pan Am, may I help you?

00:34:06.294 --> 00:34:08.629
Yeah. Hello, I'm calling about a uniform.

00:34:08.714 --> 00:34:10.965
- Hold for Purchasing.
- Thank you.

00:34:11.049 --> 00:34:12.258
Purchasing.

00:34:12.342 --> 00:34:15.010
I'm a copilot based out of
San Francisco.

00:34:15.137 --> 00:34:17.263
I flew a flight into New York last night,

00:34:17.347 --> 00:34:20.641
but the problem is I'm headed out
to Paris in three hours.

00:34:20.726 --> 00:34:22.393
How can we help you?

00:34:22.477 --> 00:34:25.980
I sent my uniform to be cleaned
through the hotel

00:34:26.189 --> 00:34:28.023
and I guess they must have lost it.

00:34:28.150 --> 00:34:30.443
They lost a uniform.
Happens all the time.

00:34:30.527 --> 00:34:33.487
Go down to the Well-Built Uniform
Company at 9th and Broadway.

00:34:33.572 --> 00:34:34.655
They're our uniform supplier.

00:34:34.740 --> 00:34:36.741
I'll tell Mr. Rosen you're coming.

00:34:36.825 --> 00:34:38.784
You look too young to be a pilot.

00:34:38.869 --> 00:34:40.494
I'm a copilot.

00:34:40.829 --> 00:34:42.371
Why so nervous?

00:34:42.831 --> 00:34:47.042
How would you feel if you lost
your uniform first week on the job?

00:34:47.169 --> 00:34:50.171
Relax.
Pan Am has got lots of uniforms.

00:34:50.839 --> 00:34:52.506
It's gonna be $164.

00:34:53.383 --> 00:34:55.509
Great. I'll write you a check.

00:34:55.594 --> 00:34:57.720
Sorry, no checks, no cash.

00:34:57.846 --> 00:35:00.306
You'll have to fill in
your employee I.D. number.

00:35:00.390 --> 00:35:04.518
I'll bill Pan Am, and they'll take it out
of your next paycheck.

00:35:05.854 --> 00:35:07.021
Even better.

00:35:09.191 --> 00:35:10.399
Dear Dad,

00:35:10.525 --> 00:35:13.569
you always told me
that an honest man has nothing to fear.

00:35:13.695 --> 00:35:16.530
So I'm trying my best not to be afraid.

00:35:16.698 --> 00:35:19.742
I'm sorry I ran away,
but you don't have to worry.

00:35:19.868 --> 00:35:24.205
I'm gonna get it all back now, Daddy.
I promise. I'm gonna get it all back.

00:35:30.921 --> 00:35:32.546
Are you a real live pilot?

00:35:32.631 --> 00:35:34.882
I sure am, little lady. What's your name?

00:35:34.966 --> 00:35:37.635
- Celine.
- Celine, it's a pleasure to meet you.

00:35:37.719 --> 00:35:40.137
It's a pleasure to meet you, too.

00:35:43.934 --> 00:35:48.312
That's 50, 70, 80, 90,

00:35:48.396 --> 00:35:50.147
$100.

00:35:50.232 --> 00:35:52.525
You have yourself a great time in Paris.

00:35:52.609 --> 00:35:54.068
I always do.

00:35:54.653 --> 00:35:56.070
Excuse me.

00:35:57.405 --> 00:35:59.406
I'm John Modiger. I manage this branch.

00:35:59.491 --> 00:36:01.700
I want to thank you for coming in
and using our institution.

00:36:01.785 --> 00:36:03.869
It's a pleasure to meet you, John.
I'll be back again.

00:36:03.954 --> 00:36:04.954
Good.

00:36:05.163 --> 00:36:07.581
Have you stayed with us before?

00:36:07.916 --> 00:36:11.168
No, I've been primarily based
on the West Coast.

00:36:11.753 --> 00:36:13.671
Is it all right if I write you a check
for the room?

00:36:13.755 --> 00:36:15.798
- No problem, sir.
- Great.

00:36:25.183 --> 00:36:28.435
I was also wondering
if I could write you a personal check?

00:36:28.520 --> 00:36:31.730
For airline personnel,
we cash personal checks up to $100.

00:36:31.815 --> 00:36:33.482
Payroll checks we cash up to 300.

00:36:35.110 --> 00:36:37.778
Did you say 300 for a payroll check?

00:36:42.701 --> 00:36:44.159
Dear Dad,

00:36:44.369 --> 00:36:47.746
I've decided to become a pilot
for Pan American Airways,

00:36:47.831 --> 00:36:50.249
the most trusted name in the skies.

00:36:50.333 --> 00:36:54.545
They've accepted me into their training
program and told me if I work hard,

00:36:54.629 --> 00:36:56.881
I should earn my wings real soon.

00:36:56.965 --> 00:37:00.092
Please get in touch with Joanna Carlton
from the 10th grade.

00:37:00.176 --> 00:37:03.304
Tell her I'm sorry that I could not
take her to the junior prom.

00:37:03.388 --> 00:37:05.681
Love, your son, Frank.

00:37:44.262 --> 00:37:46.430
- Hello, how are you?
- Fine, thank you.

00:37:46.514 --> 00:37:48.641
I have a payroll check I'd like to cash.

00:37:48.725 --> 00:37:50.184
Certainly.

00:37:51.895 --> 00:37:53.270
Excuse me.

00:37:54.022 --> 00:37:56.023
I'm sure you hear this all the time,

00:37:56.107 --> 00:37:59.693
but you have the most beautiful eyes
I have ever seen.

00:38:00.445 --> 00:38:02.947
Yeah, I do get that all the time.

00:38:03.865 --> 00:38:05.366
How would you like it?

00:38:20.966 --> 00:38:25.260
I'm sorry, sir. We won't have any cash
until the banks open in an hour.

00:38:25.387 --> 00:38:28.889
But I'm sure they can cash your check
at the airport.

00:38:29.599 --> 00:38:30.891
The airport?

00:38:31.017 --> 00:38:33.268
Who cashes checks at the airport?

00:38:33.395 --> 00:38:36.897
The airlines.
They've always taken care of their own.

00:38:45.782 --> 00:38:48.283
- Hello.
- Hi. Are you deadheading?

00:38:48.910 --> 00:38:49.952
What?

00:38:50.078 --> 00:38:52.413
Are you my deadhead to Miami?

00:38:54.749 --> 00:38:56.083
Yes.

00:38:56.918 --> 00:38:59.586
Yeah, I'm the deadhead. Here you go.

00:39:00.213 --> 00:39:03.424
You're a little late,
but the jump seat is open.

00:39:05.885 --> 00:39:08.804
It's been a while since I've done this.
Which one is the jump seat again?

00:39:11.224 --> 00:39:12.975
Have a nice flight.

00:39:13.143 --> 00:39:15.060
Are you my deadhead?

00:39:17.397 --> 00:39:20.649
Frank, Captain Oliver.
John Larkin, the copilot.

00:39:20.775 --> 00:39:22.526
Fred Tulley, flight engineer.

00:39:22.610 --> 00:39:25.362
Frank Taylor, Pan Am.
Thanks for giving me a lift, boys.

00:39:25.447 --> 00:39:28.365
Go ahead and take a seat, Frank.
We're about to push.

00:39:28.450 --> 00:39:30.617
What kind of equipment you on, DC-8?

00:39:30.744 --> 00:39:31.827
707.

00:39:32.162 --> 00:39:34.371
You turning around on the redeye?

00:39:34.456 --> 00:39:36.790
I'm jumping puddles
for the next few months,

00:39:36.916 --> 00:39:40.127
trying to earn my keep running
leap frogs for the weak and weary.

00:39:40.253 --> 00:39:42.796
No shame in that. We all did it.

00:39:49.971 --> 00:39:52.014
- Have a seat.
- Thank you.

00:39:53.141 --> 00:39:55.309
Would you like a drink after takeoff?

00:39:55.435 --> 00:39:56.602
Milk?

00:39:57.020 --> 00:39:58.979
- Eighty knots.
- Check.

00:39:59.481 --> 00:40:01.106
V-one. Rotate.

00:40:04.110 --> 00:40:05.986
V-two. Positive rate.

00:40:06.112 --> 00:40:07.362
Gear up.

00:40:08.156 --> 00:40:10.824
Dear Dad,
today was graduation.

00:40:11.367 --> 00:40:15.996
I am now a copilot,
earning $1,400 a month, plus benefits.

00:40:16.289 --> 00:40:20.250
And the best part is,
they tell me my family can fly for free.

00:40:20.335 --> 00:40:23.212
So tell Mom to pack her bags
and buy a new swimsuit

00:40:23.338 --> 00:40:26.715
because I'm taking us all to Hawaii
for Christmas.

00:40:26.841 --> 00:40:30.219
I love you, Dad. Aloha, Frank.

00:40:31.179 --> 00:40:32.596
- Hello, deadhead.
- Hello.

00:40:32.680 --> 00:40:34.723
Enjoying your free ride?

00:40:40.730 --> 00:40:42.022
Marci,

00:40:43.233 --> 00:40:45.025
did you drop this?

00:40:48.029 --> 00:40:51.031
- Must have slipped right off your neck.
- No.

00:40:52.700 --> 00:40:53.826
No!

00:40:56.204 --> 00:40:59.081
Yes, yes, yes!

00:41:06.923 --> 00:41:08.841
Why are you stopping?

00:41:10.260 --> 00:41:12.886
I want to tell you something, Marci.

00:41:14.514 --> 00:41:16.223
This is by far

00:41:17.517 --> 00:41:20.561
the best date I have ever been on.

00:41:52.635 --> 00:41:55.512
Welcome to Miami Mutual Bank.
How may I help you?

00:41:55.597 --> 00:41:58.223
My name is Frank Taylor.
I'm a copilot for Pan Am.

00:41:58.308 --> 00:42:01.435
I'd like to cash this check and then

00:42:02.437 --> 00:42:04.771
I'd like to take you out for a steak dinner.

00:42:15.283 --> 00:42:17.701
Then we feed the checks
into the MICR machine,

00:42:17.785 --> 00:42:19.244
which uses special ink to encode

00:42:19.329 --> 00:42:22.122
the account numbers
on the bottom of the checks.

00:42:22.832 --> 00:42:25.125
And where are these numbers?

00:42:26.920 --> 00:42:28.962
- They're right here.
- Right there?

00:42:32.634 --> 00:42:34.635
They're called routing numbers.

00:42:34.761 --> 00:42:37.471
So where do the checks get routed to?

00:42:39.015 --> 00:42:42.100
I don't exactly know.
Nobody ever asked me that before.

00:42:43.645 --> 00:42:47.064
Our next item up for bid is also from
the Jersey Central Bank foreclosure.

00:42:47.148 --> 00:42:50.484
This is a MICR encoder,
a machine used to encode bank checks.

00:42:50.610 --> 00:42:51.985
Do I have an opening bid?

00:42:52.111 --> 00:42:53.904
Our unknown subject
is a paperhanger

00:42:53.988 --> 00:42:55.447
who started working on the East Coast.

00:42:55.531 --> 00:42:57.241
In the last few weeks,
this unsub has developed

00:42:57.325 --> 00:43:00.244
a new form of check fraud
I'm calling "The Float."

00:43:00.328 --> 00:43:03.205
What he's doing is he's opening
checking accounts at various banks,

00:43:03.331 --> 00:43:06.792
then changing the MICR ink routing
numbers at the bottom of those checks.

00:43:06.876 --> 00:43:10.587
Next slide, please. Next slide, please.

00:43:11.172 --> 00:43:14.049
The remote thing is broken.
You'll have to do it by hand.

00:43:16.344 --> 00:43:19.680
Agent Mullen, it should be
the square button by the side.

00:43:19.806 --> 00:43:22.182
This carousel doesn't work.
It's a bad carousel.

00:43:22.308 --> 00:43:24.059
- Thank you.
- Move it manually.

00:43:24.185 --> 00:43:27.813
This is a map of the 12 banks
of the U.S. Federal Reserve.

00:43:27.897 --> 00:43:29.147
Slide.

00:43:30.191 --> 00:43:32.526
MICR scanners at every bank
read these numbers

00:43:32.610 --> 00:43:34.569
at the bottom of the check. Slide.

00:43:34.654 --> 00:43:37.990
And then ship that check off
to its corresponding branch.

00:43:38.074 --> 00:43:41.576
Carl, for those of us
who are unfamiliar with bank fraud,

00:43:41.828 --> 00:43:44.955
you mind telling us
what the hell you're talking about?

00:43:45.039 --> 00:43:49.126
The East Coast branches
are numbered 01 to 06.

00:43:49.210 --> 00:43:51.795
The central branch is 07, 08,
so on and so forth.

00:43:51.879 --> 00:43:54.548
You mean those numbers at the bottom
of a check actually mean something?

00:43:54.674 --> 00:43:58.635
All of this was in the report I filed
two days ago. If you change

00:43:58.720 --> 00:44:03.056
a 02 to a 12, that means that check,

00:44:03.266 --> 00:44:04.474
which was cashed in New York,

00:44:04.559 --> 00:44:06.018
does not go
to the New York Federal Branch,

00:44:06.102 --> 00:44:10.439
but it is re-routed all the way
to the San Francisco Federal Branch.

00:44:10.523 --> 00:44:13.025
The bank doesn't even know
the check has bounced for two weeks.

00:44:13.109 --> 00:44:15.736
Which means our unsub
can stay in one place,

00:44:15.862 --> 00:44:19.573
paper the same city over and over again
while his checks circle the country.

00:44:19.699 --> 00:44:21.908
You want to talk to my wife.

00:44:22.410 --> 00:44:24.745
She's the one who balances
the checkbook at our house.

00:44:30.209 --> 00:44:31.585
Next slide.

00:44:38.718 --> 00:44:39.926
Daddy.

00:44:42.263 --> 00:44:44.973
My son, the birdman.
That's some uniform, Frank.

00:44:45.099 --> 00:44:46.808
What do you think?

00:44:47.477 --> 00:44:48.643
Nice.

00:44:48.936 --> 00:44:50.270
Sit down.

00:44:53.399 --> 00:44:56.026
Dad, have you gotten the postcards?

00:44:56.110 --> 00:44:57.361
Of course.

00:44:57.445 --> 00:44:58.945
This fork is ice-cold.

00:44:59.072 --> 00:45:01.990
No, Dad, that's a chilled salad fork.

00:45:03.785 --> 00:45:06.286
It's a fancy restaurant, you know.

00:45:11.209 --> 00:45:12.376
Here.

00:45:13.961 --> 00:45:16.463
- I got you something.
- What's that?

00:45:16.589 --> 00:45:17.881
Open it.

00:45:23.388 --> 00:45:25.764
You know what those are, right?

00:45:26.432 --> 00:45:30.894
Those are the keys
to a 1965 Cadillac DeVille convertible.

00:45:30.978 --> 00:45:34.398
Brand-new, Dad.
Red with white interior,

00:45:34.482 --> 00:45:37.818
split seats, air conditioning, the works.

00:45:38.152 --> 00:45:40.153
Are you giving me a Cadillac?

00:45:40.238 --> 00:45:42.322
I'm giving you a Cadillac.

00:45:42.573 --> 00:45:44.491
Dad, she's parked downstairs.

00:45:44.575 --> 00:45:47.911
When we're done eating lunch, why
don't you drive on over to Mom's house,

00:45:47.995 --> 00:45:49.996
pick her up, take a little joy ride?

00:45:50.081 --> 00:45:51.748
Do you know what would happen

00:45:51.833 --> 00:45:55.627
if the IRS found out I was driving around
in a new coupe?

00:45:57.338 --> 00:46:01.007
I took the train here, Frank.
I'm taking the train home.

00:46:03.094 --> 00:46:04.469
All right.

00:46:11.686 --> 00:46:13.603
I have plenty of money.

00:46:13.688 --> 00:46:16.022
You know, if you ever need anything.

00:46:16.149 --> 00:46:18.775
You worried? About me?

00:46:19.861 --> 00:46:21.778
No, I'm not worried.

00:46:21.863 --> 00:46:23.947
You think I can't buy my own car?

00:46:24.031 --> 00:46:27.367
Two mice fell in a bucket
of cream, Frank.

00:46:28.369 --> 00:46:29.953
Which one am I?

00:46:30.872 --> 00:46:32.956
You're that second mouse.

00:46:34.834 --> 00:46:36.960
I went by the store today.

00:46:38.296 --> 00:46:41.798
I had to close the store for a while.
It's all about timing, Frank.

00:46:41.883 --> 00:46:44.968
Goddamn government knows that.
They hit you when you're down.

00:46:45.052 --> 00:46:47.888
I wasn't going to let them take it
from me, so I just

00:46:48.014 --> 00:46:50.474
shut the doors myself, called their bluff.

00:46:55.563 --> 00:46:58.148
Sooner or later, they'll forget about me.

00:46:58.232 --> 00:46:59.733
I understand.

00:47:01.569 --> 00:47:03.236
Have you told Ma?

00:47:05.740 --> 00:47:08.825
She's so stubborn, your mother.

00:47:12.497 --> 00:47:15.499
Don't worry, I'm not going to let her go
without a fight.

00:47:15.583 --> 00:47:17.542
I'm fighting for us...

00:47:20.171 --> 00:47:21.254
Dad?

00:47:23.758 --> 00:47:26.176
Since the day we met.

00:47:26.761 --> 00:47:29.429
Daddy, out of all those men,

00:47:29.931 --> 00:47:32.599
you were the one that took her home,
remember that?

00:47:32.683 --> 00:47:34.017
Two hundred men

00:47:34.101 --> 00:47:37.604
sitting in that tiny social hall,
watching her dance.

00:47:40.274 --> 00:47:43.735
- What was the name of that town?
- Montrichard, Dad.

00:47:44.570 --> 00:47:46.780
I didn't speak a word of French,

00:47:46.864 --> 00:47:50.450
and six weeks later, she was my wife.

00:47:51.953 --> 00:47:53.620
She is your wife.

00:47:56.082 --> 00:48:00.460
My son bought me a Cadillac today.
I think that calls for a toast.

00:48:10.304 --> 00:48:12.847
To the best damn pilot in the sky.

00:48:13.933 --> 00:48:17.060
It's not what you think. I'm just a copilot.

00:48:18.813 --> 00:48:21.439
You see these people staring at you?

00:48:24.986 --> 00:48:28.196
These are the most powerful people
in New York City.

00:48:28.281 --> 00:48:33.076
They keep peeking over their shoulders,
wondering where you're going tonight.

00:48:33.160 --> 00:48:35.036
Where you going, Frank?

00:48:35.121 --> 00:48:37.372
Dad, nobody's staring at me.

00:48:37.832 --> 00:48:39.583
Some place exotic?

00:48:41.877 --> 00:48:44.296
Just tell me where you're going.

00:48:46.591 --> 00:48:48.758
Los... Hollywood.

00:48:49.010 --> 00:48:50.385
Hollywood?

00:48:53.222 --> 00:48:54.556
Come here.

00:48:56.767 --> 00:49:00.103
The rest of us
really are suckers.

00:49:06.360 --> 00:49:09.154
So I got on this red dress
and these high heels, right?

00:49:09.238 --> 00:49:10.822
I got a bra out here.

00:49:10.906 --> 00:49:13.450
I'm chasing two Puerto Rican guys
through the park.

00:49:13.534 --> 00:49:16.119
They got a suitcase
filled with bank robbery loot.

00:49:16.203 --> 00:49:18.705
Okay, I'm screaming out,
"F.B.I., freeze!"

00:49:18.789 --> 00:49:21.249
I'm reaching for my gun,
but I can't find it in the bra.

00:49:21.334 --> 00:49:23.960
It's so damn big,
I thought I was going to shoot my tits off.

00:49:27.465 --> 00:49:30.967
That's a funny story.
People always laugh at that story.

00:49:31.052 --> 00:49:32.677
Let me ask you a question,
Mr. Amdursky.

00:49:32.762 --> 00:49:36.389
If you had so much fun undercover,
why did you transfer to bank fraud?

00:49:36.474 --> 00:49:39.768
I didn't transfer.
I was censured and reassigned.

00:49:40.353 --> 00:49:43.855
It's like being punished. I was punished.
I screwed up in the field.

00:49:43.939 --> 00:49:46.983
What about you, Mr. Fox, were you
punished for screwing up in the field?

00:49:47.068 --> 00:49:49.277
No, I've never worked in the field before.

00:49:49.362 --> 00:49:50.904
I audited background investigations

00:49:50.988 --> 00:49:53.573
of Department of Justice
clerical applicants.

00:49:53.658 --> 00:49:58.161
That's just great. I ask for a team
and they drag the bottom of the Pacific.

00:49:58.704 --> 00:50:00.997
Mind if I ask you a question,
Agent Hanratty?

00:50:01.123 --> 00:50:02.666
How come you're so serious
all the time?

00:50:02.750 --> 00:50:05.335
Does it bother you, Mr. Amdursky?

00:50:05.419 --> 00:50:07.462
Yeah, it does bother me.

00:50:07.797 --> 00:50:09.673
Does it bother you, Mr. Fox?

00:50:09.757 --> 00:50:11.508
A little, I guess.

00:50:12.551 --> 00:50:15.303
Would you like to hear me tell a joke?

00:50:16.597 --> 00:50:19.557
Yeah, we'd love to hear a joke from you.

00:50:21.352 --> 00:50:22.727
Knock, knock.

00:50:22.812 --> 00:50:24.270
Who's there?

00:50:26.941 --> 00:50:28.733
Go fuck yourselves.

00:50:42.123 --> 00:50:44.791
He cashed three checks.
They all cleared.

00:50:44.875 --> 00:50:46.960
I was going to deposit this one today.

00:50:48.879 --> 00:50:50.964
I don't want any trouble.

00:50:51.590 --> 00:50:53.007
No trouble.

00:50:53.801 --> 00:50:55.093
No trouble at all.

00:50:55.177 --> 00:50:58.304
We'll just take this check
and be on our way. Thank you.

00:50:58.389 --> 00:51:00.432
Because I don't want
my customers harassed.

00:51:03.561 --> 00:51:06.271
What are you saying? He's still here?

00:51:07.022 --> 00:51:08.148
201.

00:51:10.359 --> 00:51:11.401
Thank you.

00:51:12.486 --> 00:51:14.612
- Corner here.
- Thanks, son.

00:51:16.490 --> 00:51:18.283
- Some steps.
- Steps.

00:51:22.037 --> 00:51:23.997
Mr. Murphy, how are you?

00:51:24.081 --> 00:51:25.665
- Is that Frank?
- Yeah, it's Frank.

00:51:25.750 --> 00:51:27.917
- Hey, Frank. How are you?
- How's the knee?

00:51:28.002 --> 00:51:30.170
Come on, I'll race you right now.

00:51:30.254 --> 00:51:31.963
- Take care.
- Okay, Frank.

00:51:33.132 --> 00:51:34.507
Eyeball the back? Come on, Carl.

00:51:34.592 --> 00:51:36.468
This guy's a pen-and-ink man,
a goddamn paperhanger.

00:51:36.552 --> 00:51:38.386
Why can't we go with you, Carl?

00:51:38.471 --> 00:51:43.057
Keep your eyes open, do your job
and I'll buy you both a Good Humor bar.

00:51:52.818 --> 00:51:54.986
It's all right, ma'am. F.B.I.

00:51:57.531 --> 00:51:59.657
201.

00:52:11.879 --> 00:52:13.087
F.B.I.!

00:52:22.223 --> 00:52:23.431
F.B.I.

00:52:24.433 --> 00:52:26.518
Come out of the bathroom!

00:52:27.520 --> 00:52:29.604
Step out of the bathroom!

00:52:33.526 --> 00:52:36.236
- Hands on your head.
- That's the new IBM Selectric...

00:52:36.320 --> 00:52:38.488
- Put your hands on your head!
- ...print type in five seconds...

00:52:38.572 --> 00:52:39.823
Shut up!

00:52:39.907 --> 00:52:41.866
Put your hands on your head!

00:52:41.951 --> 00:52:45.912
He's got over 200 checks,
a gallon of India ink, drafting...

00:52:45.996 --> 00:52:48.331
Even has little payroll envelopes
addressed to himself...

00:52:48.415 --> 00:52:50.708
- Put it down! Drop it!
- Relax!

00:52:51.252 --> 00:52:53.002
You're late, all right?

00:52:53.087 --> 00:52:55.880
My name's Barry Allen,
United States Secret Service.

00:52:55.965 --> 00:52:57.590
Your boy just tried
to jump out the window.

00:52:57.675 --> 00:53:01.177
- My partner has him in custody.
- I don't know what you're talking about.

00:53:01.262 --> 00:53:04.848
You think the F.B.I.
are the only ones on this guy? Come on.

00:53:04.932 --> 00:53:07.016
He's dabbling in government checks.

00:53:07.101 --> 00:53:10.854
We've been following a paper trail
on this guy for months now.

00:53:10.938 --> 00:53:13.273
You mind taking that gun
out of my face?

00:53:13.357 --> 00:53:15.358
Please. Really. It makes me nervous.

00:53:15.484 --> 00:53:17.151
Let me see some credentials.

00:53:17.736 --> 00:53:19.153
Yeah, sure.

00:53:21.031 --> 00:53:22.907
Take my whole wallet.

00:53:23.117 --> 00:53:26.452
You want my gun, too?
Come over here, take my gun.

00:53:26.871 --> 00:53:27.954
Hey. Hey, look.

00:53:28.038 --> 00:53:31.332
Just do me a favor, take a look outside.
Look out the window.

00:53:31.417 --> 00:53:34.544
My partner's walking him to the car
as we speak. Look.

00:53:37.464 --> 00:53:40.341
Old guy almost pissed in his pants
when I came through the door.

00:53:40.551 --> 00:53:43.928
He jumped right through the window
onto the hood of my car.

00:53:44.555 --> 00:53:45.722
Murph?

00:53:45.806 --> 00:53:49.559
Call the LAPD. I don't want
people walking through my crime scene.

00:53:51.896 --> 00:53:54.689
I didn't expect
the Secret Service on this.

00:53:54.815 --> 00:53:57.650
Don't worry about it.
What's your name?

00:53:58.193 --> 00:54:00.612
Hanratty, Carl Hanratty.

00:54:06.201 --> 00:54:08.786
Mind if I see some identification?

00:54:09.622 --> 00:54:12.540
You never can be
too careful these days.

00:54:13.584 --> 00:54:15.376
Well, tough luck, Carl.

00:54:15.461 --> 00:54:18.087
Five minutes earlier, you would've
landed yourself a pretty good collar.

00:54:18.172 --> 00:54:21.090
Is that right? Ten seconds later,
you'd have been shot.

00:54:22.509 --> 00:54:25.637
Mind if I come downstairs with you?
I got to take a look at this guy.

00:54:25.721 --> 00:54:28.181
Sure thing. Just do me a favor
and sit tight for a sec

00:54:28.265 --> 00:54:29.891
while I get this evidence downstairs.

00:54:29.975 --> 00:54:33.019
I don't want some maid walking
through here and making the bed.

00:54:33.103 --> 00:54:35.688
- LAPD should be here any sec.
- Wait.

00:54:40.235 --> 00:54:41.486
Your wallet.

00:54:42.363 --> 00:54:45.198
You hang onto it for a minute.
I trust you.

00:55:04.510 --> 00:55:06.427
Secret Service.

00:55:48.262 --> 00:55:49.387
Hey!

00:55:50.973 --> 00:55:52.432
God damn it!

00:55:53.976 --> 00:55:56.769
It was stupid. I made a stupid mistake.

00:55:57.604 --> 00:55:58.896
Forget about it.

00:55:58.981 --> 00:56:01.524
There are hundreds
of unknown subjects out there.

00:56:01.608 --> 00:56:05.862
I can get this guy. The worst thing
a paperhanger can do is show his face.

00:56:05.946 --> 00:56:07.280
I read the report.

00:56:07.364 --> 00:56:11.034
Six feet tall, brown hair,
27 to 30 years of age, 160 pounds.

00:56:11.118 --> 00:56:12.702
This could be almost anybody.

00:56:12.786 --> 00:56:14.871
I heard his voice. I saw his face.

00:56:14.955 --> 00:56:16.914
There's nothing for him
to hide behind anymore.

00:56:18.375 --> 00:56:19.667
Just be careful.

00:56:19.877 --> 00:56:21.794
You got 12 years in.

00:56:21.879 --> 00:56:23.588
Nobody bothers you down
on the first floor.

00:56:23.672 --> 00:56:25.423
You practically wrote
the book on bank fraud.

00:56:25.507 --> 00:56:28.593
That's the kind of thing that can
make you section chief someday.

00:56:28.677 --> 00:56:31.971
Just don't put yourself
in this type of position.

00:56:32.181 --> 00:56:33.431
What type of position?

00:56:35.350 --> 00:56:37.643
The position of being humiliated.

00:56:45.903 --> 00:56:48.696
Sean, would you like to hear me
tell a joke?

00:56:50.032 --> 00:56:51.365
Yeah. Sure.

00:56:52.534 --> 00:56:54.077
Knock, knock.

00:56:56.872 --> 00:57:01.375
My next question is,
when a pilot retires,

00:57:02.211 --> 00:57:04.796
Pan Am sends them a check
every single month?

00:57:04.880 --> 00:57:07.632
Yeah, pension program
sends a check and benefits.

00:57:07.716 --> 00:57:09.175
How much is that check for?

00:57:09.593 --> 00:57:11.260
Kid, I'm really not in the mood
for this right now.

00:57:11.345 --> 00:57:13.304
This Skywayman's driving me crazy.

00:57:13.388 --> 00:57:14.597
Who's the Skywayman?

00:57:14.681 --> 00:57:17.767
Some nut flying around the country,
posing as a Pan Am pilot.

00:57:17.851 --> 00:57:20.686
There's a column about him
in the paper today.

00:57:27.111 --> 00:57:30.947
I keep telling them it's not my problem.
This guy doesn't even fly Pan Am.

00:57:31.031 --> 00:57:34.075
Flies everybody else.
Flies United, TWA,

00:57:34.201 --> 00:57:35.868
Continental, Eastern.

00:57:36.203 --> 00:57:37.912
The Skywayman.

00:57:38.413 --> 00:57:40.581
Newspaper loves this clown.

00:57:41.416 --> 00:57:43.543
They call him the James Bond
of the sky.

00:57:46.547 --> 00:57:47.547
Did you say...

00:57:47.631 --> 00:57:49.257
Bond, James Bond.

00:57:58.934 --> 00:58:01.435
Tell me, Joan,
why does he do it?

00:58:01.562 --> 00:58:03.062
He likes to win.

00:58:03.480 --> 00:58:05.439
We'll be landing in 20 minutes.

00:58:05.566 --> 00:58:08.359
Do you want to play it easy,
or the hard way?

00:58:08.443 --> 00:58:10.153
And this isn't a tranquilizer.

00:58:10.237 --> 00:58:13.281
Pussy, you know a lot more
about planes than guns.

00:58:13.991 --> 00:58:15.491
Hello, Pussy.

00:58:16.410 --> 00:58:18.369
You're sure this is the suit, right?

00:58:18.453 --> 00:58:19.620
Positive.

00:58:19.788 --> 00:58:21.831
It's the exact suit he wore in the movie.

00:58:21.915 --> 00:58:24.167
Okay. I'll take three.

00:58:24.251 --> 00:58:25.960
Certainly, Mr. Fleming.

00:58:26.086 --> 00:58:30.298
Now all you need is one of those
little foreign sports cars that he drives.

00:58:57.910 --> 00:58:59.452
- Hello.
- Hi.

00:59:03.332 --> 00:59:05.249
Haven't I seen you before?

00:59:07.794 --> 00:59:09.086
Maybe.

00:59:09.630 --> 00:59:12.798
A couple of years ago,
I was on the cover of Seventeen.

00:59:15.093 --> 00:59:17.595
You're that model, right? Cheryl.

00:59:18.597 --> 00:59:21.474
Guys used to put your picture
on their lockers.

00:59:23.268 --> 00:59:26.145
Isn't that your silver car
I saw parked out front?

00:59:26.438 --> 00:59:28.648
Yeah. One of them.

00:59:32.986 --> 00:59:35.613
So, think I could get an autograph?

00:59:39.993 --> 00:59:41.994
Do you have a pen in your room?

01:00:16.738 --> 01:00:18.030
Shh.

01:00:20.701 --> 01:00:23.536
A man like you can buy
anything he wants.

01:00:35.215 --> 01:00:38.384
He buys a deck of cards
at the hotel gift shop.

01:00:41.722 --> 01:00:43.556
You want to see a card trick?

01:00:45.183 --> 01:00:47.184
How much did these cards cost?

01:00:49.021 --> 01:00:51.397
I don't know, 55 cents, I think.

01:00:54.735 --> 01:00:58.738
And if they sold me downstairs
at the hotel gift shop,

01:01:00.741 --> 01:01:02.742
how much would you pay?

01:01:05.579 --> 01:01:08.539
I'm sorry, how much would
I pay for what?

01:01:11.460 --> 01:01:13.085
The entire night.

01:01:15.422 --> 01:01:18.591
How much would you pay me
for the entire night?

01:01:23.221 --> 01:01:25.931
Cheryl, I really don't know.

01:01:28.101 --> 01:01:29.769
Don't be scared.

01:01:34.274 --> 01:01:35.983
Make me an offer.

01:01:43.742 --> 01:01:45.117
300?

01:01:46.453 --> 01:01:47.953
Go fish.

01:01:51.833 --> 01:01:53.459
$500?

01:01:54.169 --> 01:01:55.461
Go fish.

01:01:56.797 --> 01:01:58.255
600.

01:02:00.133 --> 01:02:01.425
Go fish!

01:02:04.763 --> 01:02:06.097
$1,000.

01:02:08.683 --> 01:02:09.809
Okay.

01:02:11.812 --> 01:02:13.646
$1,000.

01:02:15.315 --> 01:02:16.649
Okay.

01:02:17.484 --> 01:02:19.026
I'll be right back.

01:02:19.820 --> 01:02:21.445
Wait a second, where are you going?

01:02:21.530 --> 01:02:23.989
I'm going downstairs to cash a check.

01:02:25.075 --> 01:02:28.828
You think this hotel is going to cash
a $1,000 check at 3:00 a.m.?

01:02:32.165 --> 01:02:35.668
It's a New York Savings and Loan
check. It's like gold. They'll cash it.

01:02:36.086 --> 01:02:39.547
Don't you think they might get
a little suspicious? Let me see that.

01:02:41.800 --> 01:02:44.760
It's a cashier's check.
Endorse it over to me.

01:02:44.845 --> 01:02:46.345
I couldn't do that.

01:02:46.430 --> 01:02:49.849
This check is for 1,400.
We agreed upon 1,000.

01:02:51.309 --> 01:02:54.019
Why don't I give you back 400

01:02:54.813 --> 01:02:56.981
and you give me that check?

01:02:58.316 --> 01:02:59.692
Even better.

01:03:31.725 --> 01:03:33.684
Does this belong to anybody?

01:03:50.368 --> 01:03:52.244
This is Hanratty. Merry Christmas.

01:03:52.370 --> 01:03:53.746
Hello, Carl.

01:03:54.539 --> 01:03:55.664
Hello.

01:03:57.918 --> 01:04:00.252
Barry Allen, Secret Service.

01:04:01.171 --> 01:04:05.007
I've been trying to track you down now
for the last couple of hours.

01:04:05.133 --> 01:04:06.258
What do you want?

01:04:07.093 --> 01:04:10.763
I wanted to apologize
for what happened out in Los Angeles.

01:04:10.847 --> 01:04:12.014
Uh-uh. Uh-uh.

01:04:12.098 --> 01:04:14.266
No, you don't apologize to me.

01:04:14.851 --> 01:04:17.228
Do you always work
on Christmas Eve, Carl?

01:04:17.604 --> 01:04:19.522
I volunteered

01:04:19.773 --> 01:04:21.732
so the men with families
could go home early.

01:04:22.609 --> 01:04:24.818
Looked like you were wearing
a wedding ring out in Los Angeles.

01:04:24.903 --> 01:04:26.695
I thought maybe you had a family.

01:04:27.030 --> 01:04:28.531
No. No family.

01:04:30.367 --> 01:04:33.994
You want to talk to me?
Let's talk face to face.

01:04:34.287 --> 01:04:35.579
All right.

01:04:35.664 --> 01:04:39.333
I'm at my suite
at the Stuyvesant Arms, room 3113.

01:04:39.793 --> 01:04:42.920
In the morning, I leave for Las Vegas
for the weekend.

01:04:45.215 --> 01:04:47.633
You think you're going to get me again?

01:04:48.260 --> 01:04:51.887
You're not going to Vegas,
you're not in the Stuyvesant Arms.

01:04:52.806 --> 01:04:57.935
You'd love for me to send out 20 agents,
Christmas Eve, barge into your hotel,

01:04:58.228 --> 01:05:00.604
knock down the door
so you can make fools out of us all.

01:05:01.314 --> 01:05:04.608
I'm really sorry if I made a fool
out of you. I really am.

01:05:04.693 --> 01:05:06.026
Uh-uh. No.

01:05:06.111 --> 01:05:09.113
No. You do not feel sorry for me.

01:05:09.489 --> 01:05:13.826
The truth is, I knew it was you.
I didn't get the cuffs on you, but I knew.

01:05:14.911 --> 01:05:17.830
People only know
what you tell them, Carl.

01:05:18.915 --> 01:05:21.959
Then tell me this,
Barry Allen, Secret Service.

01:05:22.502 --> 01:05:25.254
How did you know
I wouldn't look in your wallet?

01:05:25.338 --> 01:05:28.340
The same reason
the Yankees always win.

01:05:28.466 --> 01:05:31.594
Nobody can keep their eyes
off the pinstripes.

01:05:31.845 --> 01:05:34.513
The Yankees win
because they have Mickey Mantle.

01:05:34.598 --> 01:05:36.849
No one ever bets on the uniform.

01:05:37.601 --> 01:05:39.643
You sure about that, Carl?

01:05:39.811 --> 01:05:42.021
I'll tell you what I am sure of.

01:05:42.147 --> 01:05:44.023
You're going to get caught.

01:05:44.691 --> 01:05:48.319
One way or another,
it's a mathematical fact. It's like Vegas.

01:05:48.445 --> 01:05:50.195
The house always wins.

01:05:55.660 --> 01:05:59.163
Well, Carl, I'm sorry, but I have to go.

01:06:00.624 --> 01:06:03.292
You didn't call just to apologize,
did you?

01:06:04.544 --> 01:06:05.794
What do you mean?

01:06:07.547 --> 01:06:09.590
You have no one else to call.

01:06:12.052 --> 01:06:13.218
Whoa!

01:06:47.087 --> 01:06:48.629
More coffee, sir?

01:06:54.969 --> 01:06:57.763
- Are you a collector?
- Of what?

01:06:57.847 --> 01:06:59.181
Captives of the Cosmic Ray,

01:06:59.265 --> 01:07:01.225
The Big Freeze,
Land of the Golden Giants.

01:07:01.309 --> 01:07:03.936
- I've got them all.
- What are you talking about?

01:07:04.688 --> 01:07:05.938
Barry Allen.

01:07:09.109 --> 01:07:10.150
The Flash.

01:07:12.445 --> 01:07:13.779
Wait, kid.

01:07:16.366 --> 01:07:17.991
You mean, like the comic book?

01:07:18.076 --> 01:07:21.120
Yeah, the comic book. When he's not
The Flash, that's his name, Barry Allen.

01:07:22.956 --> 01:07:24.331
Thank you.

01:07:28.253 --> 01:07:31.088
Now get this, he reads comic books!

01:07:31.506 --> 01:07:33.882
Comic books! Barry Allen is The Flash!

01:07:33.967 --> 01:07:36.218
Carl, slow down. I don't know
what the hell you're talking about.

01:07:36.302 --> 01:07:38.220
He's a kid. Our unsub is a kid.

01:07:38.304 --> 01:07:41.223
That's why we couldn't match his prints,
that's why he doesn't have a record.

01:07:41.307 --> 01:07:43.392
I want you to contact NYPD for every

01:07:43.476 --> 01:07:46.270
all-points juvenile runaways
in New York City.

01:07:46.354 --> 01:07:49.773
Don't forget the airports. He's been
kiting checks all over the country.

01:07:49.858 --> 01:07:51.942
- Why New York?
- The Yankees!

01:07:52.026 --> 01:07:54.486
He said something about the Yankees!

01:07:57.031 --> 01:07:58.490
Where are we on the list?

01:07:58.575 --> 01:08:01.118
Number 53, Abagnale.

01:08:04.372 --> 01:08:06.957
Good morning, ma'am,
we're the F.B.I. agents who called.

01:08:07.041 --> 01:08:08.167
Yes, I've been waiting.

01:08:08.835 --> 01:08:11.837
I hope you're all hungry.
I put out the Sara Lee.

01:08:15.258 --> 01:08:17.259
My husband, Jack, is a lawyer.

01:08:17.343 --> 01:08:19.970
What about your first husband,
Mrs. Abagnale?

01:08:20.054 --> 01:08:23.682
Abagnale. But I prefer
to be called Barnes.

01:08:25.685 --> 01:08:28.771
"Frank William Abagnale."
It says he was in the service.

01:08:28.855 --> 01:08:30.939
Did you two meet during the war?

01:08:31.775 --> 01:08:35.736
Yeah, I lived in a very small village
in France, Montrichard.

01:08:36.154 --> 01:08:39.656
The kind of place
where they never heard of Sara Lee.

01:08:40.074 --> 01:08:41.617
Help yourselves.

01:08:41.701 --> 01:08:43.535
Nobody doesn't like Sara Lee.

01:08:43.620 --> 01:08:45.120
You filled out a missing person's report

01:08:45.205 --> 01:08:48.665
for a runaway juvenile by the name of
Frank Abagnale, Jr.

01:08:49.209 --> 01:08:50.459
Is Frankie okay?

01:08:51.419 --> 01:08:52.961
You're aware of the fact that
he wrote some checks

01:08:53.046 --> 01:08:55.255
on a closed account
at Chase Manhattan Bank?

01:08:55.340 --> 01:08:58.801
Yes. The police think
he's some type of criminal.

01:08:58.885 --> 01:09:01.345
What he did was a felony, Mrs. Barnes.

01:09:01.888 --> 01:09:03.514
It was $1,000.

01:09:04.265 --> 01:09:08.101
Half the kids his age are on dope,
throwing rocks at police.

01:09:08.853 --> 01:09:13.065
And they scared me to death
because my son made a little mistake.

01:09:14.108 --> 01:09:17.110
A 17-year-old boy has to eat,

01:09:17.570 --> 01:09:19.238
has to have a place to sleep.

01:09:19.489 --> 01:09:21.365
We understand, ma'am.

01:09:22.033 --> 01:09:23.575
Would you happen to have a picture
of your son?

01:09:23.868 --> 01:09:25.577
Yes, I have his old yearbook.

01:09:35.296 --> 01:09:36.338
Okay.

01:09:38.675 --> 01:09:41.343
We need to send out
an all-office teletype.

01:09:41.427 --> 01:09:44.930
Our unsub's name
is Frank Abagnale, Jr., age 17!

01:09:45.014 --> 01:09:47.266
Is Frankie okay? Is he in trouble?

01:09:47.350 --> 01:09:50.227
Ma'am, I'm sorry to have to tell you,
your son is forging checks.

01:09:50.311 --> 01:09:53.313
Forging checks? Wait!
I'm sure we can take care of that.

01:09:53.398 --> 01:09:55.399
I'm working part-time at the church now.

01:09:55.483 --> 01:09:57.985
Just tell me how much he owes
and I'll pay you back.

01:09:58.069 --> 01:10:00.404
So far, it's about $1 .3 million.

01:10:17.964 --> 01:10:19.548
Hi, Melanie, how are you?

01:10:19.632 --> 01:10:22.134
When you're in the house,
please use an ashtray.

01:10:22.218 --> 01:10:23.969
Frank, this fondue is so good!

01:10:24.053 --> 01:10:26.930
- Great. Take this.
- Good, I love Moët!

01:10:35.315 --> 01:10:39.484
James, please! Stay away
from the hi-fi system, all right?

01:10:39.569 --> 01:10:42.487
It's a reel-to-reel,
you can't wind it like that.

01:10:45.491 --> 01:10:48.577
Christ, Terry! This is Italian knit!

01:10:48.661 --> 01:10:51.288
- Watch where you're going!
- It's just a shirt, man!

01:10:51.372 --> 01:10:53.373
Frank! Come quick!

01:10:54.083 --> 01:10:57.294
Lance just fell into the conversation pit!

01:11:02.842 --> 01:11:05.427
Excuse me,
you know where Lance Applebaum is?

01:11:05.511 --> 01:11:06.637
Thank you.

01:11:07.639 --> 01:11:09.848
These bottles need to be
labeled when you pick them up!

01:11:09.933 --> 01:11:12.225
Do you understand
how dangerous this is? Do you?

01:11:12.310 --> 01:11:15.562
Don't stand there crying. Nod your head.
Tell me you won't do it again.

01:11:15.647 --> 01:11:17.773
Now dry up and get back to work.

01:11:24.322 --> 01:11:25.364
You okay?

01:11:26.324 --> 01:11:28.825
He told me to pick up the blood, so I did.

01:11:28.910 --> 01:11:31.078
But he never told me to label it.

01:11:32.455 --> 01:11:34.456
It's okay, stop crying.

01:11:34.874 --> 01:11:36.291
What's your name?

01:11:37.251 --> 01:11:38.543
Brenda.

01:11:41.172 --> 01:11:43.340
Brenda, I wouldn't worry about it.

01:11:43.424 --> 01:11:45.842
These doctors don't know everything.

01:11:46.594 --> 01:11:48.387
It's my first week.

01:11:48.680 --> 01:11:50.514
I think they're going to fire me.

01:11:50.598 --> 01:11:53.517
No, nobody's going to fire you, Brenda.

01:11:53.893 --> 01:11:55.894
I bet you're good at your job.

01:11:57.021 --> 01:11:58.522
No, I'm not.

01:11:59.565 --> 01:12:01.984
I bet if I asked you to check
on the status

01:12:02.068 --> 01:12:03.777
of my friend Lance Applebaum,

01:12:04.612 --> 01:12:07.322
you could do that for me in a second.

01:12:14.872 --> 01:12:17.749
Mr. Applebaum fractured his ankle.

01:12:17.834 --> 01:12:21.545
Dr. Ashland is treating him
in exam room seven.

01:12:21.629 --> 01:12:24.089
You see that? No problem.

01:12:26.259 --> 01:12:28.552
This is the emergency chart.

01:12:29.137 --> 01:12:33.015
See that blue star? That means
the patient has been diagnosed.

01:12:33.099 --> 01:12:37.561
And then after he's been treated,
we put a red circle here. See?

01:12:38.896 --> 01:12:41.189
How do you like those braces?

01:12:42.650 --> 01:12:44.234
I guess they're all right.

01:12:44.944 --> 01:12:47.070
I got mine off last year.

01:12:47.989 --> 01:12:50.615
Boy, I hated them. They were bottoms.

01:12:50.825 --> 01:12:53.035
I still got to wear my mouth guard.

01:12:53.911 --> 01:12:55.746
You have really nice teeth.

01:12:57.540 --> 01:12:59.249
Well, thank you.

01:12:59.625 --> 01:13:01.877
And you have a pretty smile.

01:13:05.381 --> 01:13:09.342
No, I mean it. I really think
those braces look good on you.

01:13:09.552 --> 01:13:10.969
Thank you.

01:13:11.137 --> 01:13:12.471
You're welcome.

01:13:16.184 --> 01:13:17.184
Brenda.

01:13:17.477 --> 01:13:18.685
Yeah.

01:13:18.853 --> 01:13:21.646
Do you know if they're hiring here
at the hospital?

01:13:23.149 --> 01:13:25.859
I'm not sure. What do you want to do?

01:13:27.904 --> 01:13:29.362
I'm a doctor.

01:13:33.159 --> 01:13:34.826
Dear Dad,

01:13:34.911 --> 01:13:37.621
I decided to get off the road for a while.

01:13:37.705 --> 01:13:41.625
I've taken a night job at a hospital
and met some really nice people.

01:13:41.709 --> 01:13:43.418
Feels good to have
my feet on the ground,

01:13:43.503 --> 01:13:45.670
to wake up in the same bed every night.

01:13:47.048 --> 01:13:50.842
Who knows, maybe I'll even find
someone to settle down with.

01:13:53.679 --> 01:13:56.765
"Harvard Medical School."
Top of your class.

01:13:57.850 --> 01:14:00.602
"Southern California
Children's Hospital."

01:14:01.104 --> 01:14:04.439
That is a pretty impressive résumé,
Dr. Conners.

01:14:04.732 --> 01:14:06.399
Unfortunately,

01:14:07.026 --> 01:14:09.111
the only thing I need is.

01:14:14.742 --> 01:14:17.869
Someone to babysit
six interns and 20 nurses.

01:14:18.871 --> 01:14:20.372
But...

01:14:22.041 --> 01:14:25.377
Hell, I doubt that you'd be interested
in that.

01:14:28.214 --> 01:14:31.383
In the past, they've always
let me choose my own nurses.

01:14:32.927 --> 01:14:34.219
Dr. Connelly.

01:14:35.721 --> 01:14:37.305
- Dr. Harris.
- Present.

01:14:38.391 --> 01:14:39.558
Dr. Ashland.

01:14:39.642 --> 01:14:41.059
Dr. Conners?

01:14:41.769 --> 01:14:43.728
You gonna take roll every night?

01:14:43.813 --> 01:14:45.772
Yes, I will, Dr. Ashland.

01:14:45.898 --> 01:14:49.192
And if you're going to be late,
I suggest you bring a note.

01:14:52.738 --> 01:14:54.239
Miss Basmann.

01:14:54.740 --> 01:14:56.158
Miss Mace.

01:14:56.826 --> 01:14:58.326
Miss Strong.

01:14:58.578 --> 01:14:59.661
Here.

01:14:59.745 --> 01:15:01.079
Nurse Brown.

01:15:02.248 --> 01:15:03.582
Nurse Sanford.

01:15:04.000 --> 01:15:06.543
Thirty milligrams
of codeine every four hours.

01:15:06.627 --> 01:15:10.463
Run the plasma at 60 drops a minute
till we calculate the fluid requirements.

01:15:10.590 --> 01:15:14.134
What do you estimate the degree
and extent of the burns, Kildare?

01:15:14.260 --> 01:15:17.429
Second and third-degree burns
over about 20% of the body surface.

01:15:17.513 --> 01:15:21.016
- Do you concur?
- I concur. Let's get him up to Pediatrics.

01:15:27.690 --> 01:15:28.773
Hello, Brenda.

01:15:28.858 --> 01:15:30.275
Hi, Dr. Conners.

01:15:30.943 --> 01:15:33.528
- You need to sign these.
- Thank you.

01:15:40.703 --> 01:15:42.662
Do you notice anything different
about me?

01:15:42.747 --> 01:15:44.915
You got your braces off! Come here.

01:15:44.999 --> 01:15:47.500
I've been trying to show you all night!

01:15:48.836 --> 01:15:49.836
Wow.

01:15:50.213 --> 01:15:51.546
Good job.

01:15:51.631 --> 01:15:54.466
Did it hurt when they took them off?
Mine felt so weird after.

01:15:54.550 --> 01:15:57.469
I keep rubbing my tongue over them.
I can't stop!

01:15:57.678 --> 01:15:59.054
They're so slippery.

01:15:59.138 --> 01:16:02.307
- It feels good, doesn't it?
- Yeah, it feels incredible.

01:16:12.568 --> 01:16:13.902
Oh, my!

01:16:15.238 --> 01:16:16.655
I'm sorry.

01:16:28.501 --> 01:16:31.795
Dr. Conners to the E.R.
Dr. Conners to the E.R.

01:16:31.879 --> 01:16:33.004
Shouldn't you go?

01:16:33.089 --> 01:16:37.717
No. They have a staff doctor
in the emergency ward, we'll be fine.

01:16:44.016 --> 01:16:45.934
What if he's in surgery?

01:16:47.853 --> 01:16:49.437
Do you really think I have to go?

01:16:50.022 --> 01:16:51.773
In here, Dr. Conners.

01:17:08.916 --> 01:17:12.377
Gentlemen, what seems
to be the problem?

01:17:13.087 --> 01:17:17.632
Bicycle accident. A fractured tibia
about five inches below the patella.

01:17:18.217 --> 01:17:19.342
Hmm.

01:17:22.763 --> 01:17:24.222
Dr. Harris.

01:17:24.807 --> 01:17:26.391
Do you concur?

01:17:27.059 --> 01:17:28.977
Concur with what, sir?

01:17:29.645 --> 01:17:32.814
With what Dr. Ashland just said.
Do you concur?

01:17:34.984 --> 01:17:37.902
Well, it was a bicycle accident.
The boy told us.

01:17:38.988 --> 01:17:40.280
So you concur?

01:17:41.949 --> 01:17:45.618
We should take an X-ray, stitch him up
and put him in a walking cast.

01:17:49.415 --> 01:17:51.374
Very good, Dr. Ashland. Very good.

01:17:51.459 --> 01:17:54.419
Well, you don't seem
to have much need for me.

01:17:54.670 --> 01:17:55.754
Carry on.

01:17:58.174 --> 01:17:59.966
I blew it, didn't I?

01:18:01.010 --> 01:18:02.594
Why didn't I concur?

01:18:24.700 --> 01:18:26.326
Make yourself at home!

01:18:27.661 --> 01:18:29.162
Frank Abagnale, Sr.

01:18:29.330 --> 01:18:31.039
You're not a cop.

01:18:32.500 --> 01:18:34.793
Special Agent Hanratty, F.B.I.

01:18:35.336 --> 01:18:38.505
You're not a cop.
My landlord said you were not a cop.

01:18:38.964 --> 01:18:42.592
If you're going to arrest me,
I'd like to put on a different suit.

01:18:42.676 --> 01:18:44.969
- If that's okay...
- I'm not here to arrest you.

01:18:45.054 --> 01:18:47.347
I'm looking for your son. He's in trouble.

01:18:47.473 --> 01:18:49.140
Do you know where he is?

01:18:51.477 --> 01:18:54.938
If I tell you where he is,
will you promise not to tell his mother?

01:18:55.022 --> 01:18:56.106
Sure.

01:18:57.316 --> 01:19:01.403
Frank made up a fake I.D.
and enlisted in the Marine Corps.

01:19:01.487 --> 01:19:03.571
He's over in Vietnam right now.

01:19:03.656 --> 01:19:05.740
That kid is halfway around the world,

01:19:05.825 --> 01:19:09.869
crawling through the damn jungle,
fighting the communists, so...

01:19:11.330 --> 01:19:15.333
Please, don't come to my home
and call my boy a criminal...

01:19:15.584 --> 01:19:19.337
I never said he was a criminal,
Mr. Abagnale. I said he was in trouble.

01:19:20.798 --> 01:19:24.134
If you'd like to give me a call and talk,
here's my number.

01:19:36.564 --> 01:19:38.523
You're not a father, are you?

01:19:40.609 --> 01:19:41.734
Pardon me?

01:19:41.861 --> 01:19:44.154
If you were a father, you'd know.

01:19:44.238 --> 01:19:49.701
I would never give up my son.
I would never give up my son.

01:19:51.704 --> 01:19:53.746
Yes, sir. I understand.

01:19:54.707 --> 01:19:56.541
Sean, now get this.

01:19:57.042 --> 01:20:01.713
"Riverbend Apartments, 415 Landover,
Atlanta, Georgia."

01:20:02.173 --> 01:20:03.840
Atlanta, Georgia.

01:20:03.924 --> 01:20:08.636
I'm on my way to the airport. I'll meet
the team in four hours. Bye-bye!

01:20:10.890 --> 01:20:13.141
Come on, it's okay.

01:20:14.143 --> 01:20:15.727
You don't have to cry.

01:20:16.061 --> 01:20:20.482
I'm sorry! I'm so sorry, Frank!
I can't do this.

01:20:20.566 --> 01:20:22.233
Brenda, listen to me.

01:20:23.235 --> 01:20:25.361
I don't care if you're a virgin, all right?

01:20:25.446 --> 01:20:26.696
Really, I can wait.

01:20:27.907 --> 01:20:29.616
I'm not a virgin.

01:20:34.079 --> 01:20:36.498
I had an abortion two years ago.

01:20:40.085 --> 01:20:42.587
My parents had a friend do it.

01:20:43.088 --> 01:20:46.299
A man that my father plays golf with.

01:20:47.801 --> 01:20:51.012
And when I got better,
they kicked me out of the house.

01:20:51.931 --> 01:20:55.475
I had an abortion
and I wasn't their daughter anymore!

01:20:56.310 --> 01:20:59.270
I'm so sorry. Please don't be mad at me.

01:21:00.940 --> 01:21:02.106
No, no.

01:21:02.274 --> 01:21:04.442
- Please don't be mad at me.
- Shh.

01:21:06.445 --> 01:21:08.947
What if I spoke to your parents?

01:21:09.114 --> 01:21:11.282
Maybe I can straighten things out.

01:21:11.367 --> 01:21:14.953
I ask them all the time,
but they said I still can't come home.

01:21:15.829 --> 01:21:18.957
And my daddy's a lawyer.

01:21:27.341 --> 01:21:28.508
Brenda?

01:21:31.136 --> 01:21:33.846
What if you were engaged to a doctor?

01:21:34.515 --> 01:21:36.391
Would that change anything?

01:21:36.475 --> 01:21:37.725
What?

01:21:41.522 --> 01:21:44.023
What if I went to your parents,

01:21:45.484 --> 01:21:47.819
and I spoke to your father

01:21:51.073 --> 01:21:53.700
and I asked permission to marry you?

01:22:07.423 --> 01:22:09.841
- It's empty.
- Nobody here.

01:22:33.866 --> 01:22:36.200
Dr. Conners, are you Lutheran?

01:22:37.703 --> 01:22:39.454
Yes, I am a Lutheran.

01:22:39.538 --> 01:22:41.706
But please, call me Frank.

01:22:43.042 --> 01:22:45.710
Frank, would you like to say grace?

01:22:51.216 --> 01:22:53.551
Unless you're not comfortable.

01:22:53.886 --> 01:22:55.303
Absolutely.

01:23:05.814 --> 01:23:08.900
Two little mice fell
into a bucket of cream.

01:23:10.736 --> 01:23:12.820
The first mouse
quickly gave up and drowned,

01:23:12.905 --> 01:23:14.739
but the second mouse struggled so hard

01:23:14.823 --> 01:23:17.450
that he eventually churned
that cream into butter,

01:23:18.243 --> 01:23:19.702
and he walked out.

01:23:21.246 --> 01:23:22.246
Amen.

01:23:25.084 --> 01:23:26.918
That was beautiful.

01:23:27.252 --> 01:23:29.587
The mouse churned
that cream into butter.

01:23:32.758 --> 01:23:33.966
That's right.

01:23:35.302 --> 01:23:36.719
Thank you.

01:23:36.804 --> 01:23:39.931
Frank, have you decided which hospital
you want to work at in New Orleans?

01:23:41.934 --> 01:23:45.561
To be quite honest,
I'm thinking about getting back into law.

01:23:46.355 --> 01:23:49.107
Oh, my! Are you a doctor or a lawyer?

01:23:49.942 --> 01:23:53.361
Before I went to medical school,
I passed the bar in California.

01:23:53.445 --> 01:23:56.197
I practiced law for one year,
then I decided,

01:23:56.448 --> 01:23:58.991
why not try my hand at pediatrics?

01:24:00.119 --> 01:24:02.328
You're just full of surprises.

01:24:03.288 --> 01:24:04.497
Yeah.

01:24:05.541 --> 01:24:08.876
A doctor and a lawyer.
Brenda hit the jackpot.

01:24:09.378 --> 01:24:11.337
Where did you go to law school?

01:24:11.797 --> 01:24:13.214
Berkeley.

01:24:15.718 --> 01:24:17.677
Oh, my gosh.
Isn't that where you went, Daddy?

01:24:17.803 --> 01:24:19.429
Maybe Frank could come
work for you, Roger.

01:24:19.513 --> 01:24:22.765
You're always saying how hard it is
to find assistant prosecutors.

01:24:22.850 --> 01:24:25.893
Could he, Daddy? Could he, please?
Could he come work with you, please?

01:24:25.978 --> 01:24:27.562
Was that snake Hollingsworth

01:24:27.646 --> 01:24:30.231
still teaching there
when you went through Berkeley?

01:24:32.067 --> 01:24:33.067
Hollingsworth.

01:24:33.152 --> 01:24:35.486
Yes. Grumpy old Hollingsworth, right?

01:24:35.571 --> 01:24:37.321
Meaner than ever.

01:24:37.823 --> 01:24:39.699
And that dog of his?

01:24:42.536 --> 01:24:46.038
Tell me, Frank,
what was the name of his little dog?

01:24:55.674 --> 01:24:57.091
I'm sorry.

01:24:58.927 --> 01:25:00.470
The dog was dead.

01:25:00.846 --> 01:25:01.846
Oh.

01:25:03.724 --> 01:25:05.349
How unfortunate.

01:25:06.769 --> 01:25:07.852
Yeah.

01:25:38.217 --> 01:25:40.718
A doctor, a lawyer, a Lutheran.

01:25:43.555 --> 01:25:45.640
So, what are you, Frank?

01:25:46.558 --> 01:25:49.936
'Cause I think you're about to ask
for my daughter's hand in marriage,

01:25:50.062 --> 01:25:51.521
and I have a right to know.

01:25:52.105 --> 01:25:53.731
Know what, sir?

01:25:54.316 --> 01:25:55.733
The truth.

01:25:57.903 --> 01:25:59.946
Tell me the truth, Frank.

01:26:01.323 --> 01:26:03.407
What are you doing here?

01:26:05.160 --> 01:26:08.079
What is a man like you
doing with Brenda?

01:26:09.665 --> 01:26:13.125
If you want my blessing,
if you want my daughter,

01:26:13.502 --> 01:26:15.670
I'd like to hear it from you now.

01:26:18.423 --> 01:26:20.174
The truth is, sir...

01:26:24.096 --> 01:26:26.264
The truth is that...

01:26:28.767 --> 01:26:31.310
I'm not a doctor, I'm not a lawyer.

01:26:33.939 --> 01:26:35.982
I'm not an airline pilot.

01:26:37.943 --> 01:26:39.777
I'm nothing, really.

01:26:46.994 --> 01:26:50.121
I'm just a kid
who's in love with your daughter.

01:26:52.374 --> 01:26:53.499
No.

01:27:03.010 --> 01:27:04.969
You know what you are?

01:27:05.304 --> 01:27:07.054
You're a romantic.

01:27:07.180 --> 01:27:10.182
Men like us are nothing
without the women we love.

01:27:10.309 --> 01:27:13.895
I must confess,
I'm guilty of the same foolish whimsy.

01:27:13.979 --> 01:27:16.105
I proposed to Carol after five dates

01:27:16.189 --> 01:27:18.983
with two nickels in my pockets
and holes in my shoes

01:27:19.067 --> 01:27:20.985
because I knew she was the one.

01:27:21.987 --> 01:27:23.738
So go ahead, Frank.

01:27:27.659 --> 01:27:29.327
Don't be afraid.

01:27:29.536 --> 01:27:32.496
Ask the question you came here
to ask me.

01:27:37.669 --> 01:27:41.172
What would I have to do to take the bar
here in New Orleans?

01:27:46.094 --> 01:27:48.095
No, the other question.

01:27:53.352 --> 01:27:55.353
Right through that door.

01:27:57.189 --> 01:27:59.231
Good luck, Mr. Conners.

01:27:59.900 --> 01:28:01.108
Thank you.

01:28:09.201 --> 01:28:10.618
Hey, Frank.

01:28:11.078 --> 01:28:13.412
You know what I could never figure out?

01:28:13.538 --> 01:28:16.332
How did you cheat on the bar exam
in Louisiana?

01:28:16.416 --> 01:28:18.042
What's the difference?

01:28:18.126 --> 01:28:22.129
- Someone took the test for you?
- I'm going to prison for a long time.

01:28:22.589 --> 01:28:25.091
Seriously, what's the difference?

01:28:25.467 --> 01:28:27.468
It's a simple question.

01:28:28.553 --> 01:28:31.055
Are you going to eat that éclair?

01:28:32.724 --> 01:28:35.393
Yeah. I'm saving it for later.

01:28:36.436 --> 01:28:38.437
Or you want to split it with me?

01:28:38.563 --> 01:28:39.605
No.

01:28:43.110 --> 01:28:45.736
Give me half that éclair and I'll tell you.

01:28:56.581 --> 01:28:59.166
I'm gonna figure it out sooner or later.

01:29:05.799 --> 01:29:09.343
You'll be working under Phillip Rigby
in corporate law.

01:29:09.678 --> 01:29:12.763
Why don't you settle in,
organize your desk?

01:29:15.434 --> 01:29:17.435
We're having lunch at 12:30

01:29:17.519 --> 01:29:21.897
with the Attorney General
and Governor McKeithen himself.

01:29:22.441 --> 01:29:23.607
A governor!

01:29:23.692 --> 01:29:25.317
Did we spell it right?

01:29:25.444 --> 01:29:26.694
You sure did.

01:29:27.029 --> 01:29:28.529
Congratulations.

01:29:28.613 --> 01:29:30.865
- Thank you, sir.
- Welcome aboard.

01:29:38.206 --> 01:29:40.958
Look at this photograph, Mr. Stewart.

01:29:41.293 --> 01:29:45.296
It's a photograph of Prentice York,
where they found him, dead.

01:29:45.714 --> 01:29:48.632
Here is an enlargement
of part of that photograph.

01:29:49.009 --> 01:29:52.636
This is a photograph of the defendant's
signature on a canceled check.

01:29:52.721 --> 01:29:56.640
Here is an enlargement of that
same signature, which matches

01:29:56.892 --> 01:29:59.894
the signature on the letters
that he wrote to Mrs. Simon,

01:29:59.978 --> 01:30:04.190
which discuss the possibility of
defrauding the great state of Louisiana.

01:30:04.316 --> 01:30:07.151
Your Honor,
ladies and gentlemen of the jury,

01:30:07.235 --> 01:30:11.530
this is irrefutable evidence
that the defendant is, in fact, lying.

01:30:17.496 --> 01:30:21.457
Mr. Conners,
this is a preliminary hearing.

01:30:22.250 --> 01:30:24.835
There is no defendant.

01:30:26.838 --> 01:30:29.715
There is no jury.

01:30:31.510 --> 01:30:32.760
It's just me.

01:30:34.054 --> 01:30:35.262
Son,

01:30:35.514 --> 01:30:38.099
what in the hell is wrong with you?

01:30:39.559 --> 01:30:41.852
Is that Mitch? Roger!

01:30:42.687 --> 01:30:43.938
It's Mitch!

01:30:44.106 --> 01:30:45.940
I lost all track of time.

01:30:46.024 --> 01:30:48.359
As studio guests
for the sing-along tonight,

01:30:48.443 --> 01:30:49.485
we have the children's choir

01:30:49.569 --> 01:30:51.946
of Saint Monica's Church
in New York City.

01:30:52.030 --> 01:30:56.117
Won't you join them and the gang
in a few songs for the lrish? Everybody!

01:32:26.958 --> 01:32:28.083
Dad?

01:32:32.464 --> 01:32:34.215
What are you doing here?

01:32:36.218 --> 01:32:37.968
I came to see you.

01:32:42.140 --> 01:32:44.058
What are you doing dressed like this?

01:32:44.142 --> 01:32:46.101
I took a government job.

01:32:46.228 --> 01:32:49.605
You see what I'm doing?
Do you have a good lawyer?

01:32:50.857 --> 01:32:52.358
I sort of am a lawyer now.

01:32:52.442 --> 01:32:54.985
Look at this letter. The IRS wants more.

01:32:55.946 --> 01:32:58.489
I had a deal with them. Two penalties.

01:32:58.573 --> 01:33:01.242
They ate the cake,
now they want the crumbs.

01:33:01.952 --> 01:33:03.577
I want to sue them.

01:33:04.746 --> 01:33:06.830
Now they want the crumbs.

01:33:08.583 --> 01:33:09.833
Sit down.

01:33:09.918 --> 01:33:13.170
They're trying to scare me,
intimidate me. You know what?

01:33:14.839 --> 01:33:16.215
You know what?

01:33:16.299 --> 01:33:18.342
I'll make them chase me

01:33:18.927 --> 01:33:21.178
for the rest of their lives!

01:33:28.144 --> 01:33:30.229
It's great to see you, Daddy.

01:33:32.065 --> 01:33:34.483
Sit down, I want to show you something.

01:33:36.903 --> 01:33:39.196
I came here to give you this.

01:33:39.281 --> 01:33:42.241
It's an invitation to an engagement party.

01:33:44.995 --> 01:33:47.204
Daddy, I'm getting married.

01:33:47.998 --> 01:33:50.207
Can you believe that
I'm getting married?

01:33:50.292 --> 01:33:53.585
You don't need to worry
about anything now, Dad. Listen.

01:33:53.670 --> 01:33:57.298
I'm getting a brand-new Cadillac,
I'm getting a $60,000 house,

01:33:57.382 --> 01:33:59.091
I'm getting it all back.

01:33:59.217 --> 01:34:03.971
All the jewelry, the furs, everything
they took from us, I'll get it back.

01:34:07.350 --> 01:34:09.310
Has Ma seen you dressed like this?

01:34:10.895 --> 01:34:13.105
Yeah, she came to pick up some boxes.

01:34:13.523 --> 01:34:15.316
That's okay. You know why?

01:34:15.400 --> 01:34:17.735
Because she's going to the wedding
with us.

01:34:17.861 --> 01:34:20.195
I'm gonna get you
a brand-new suit, Dad.

01:34:20.655 --> 01:34:23.157
One of those Manhattan Eagle,
three-button black pearl suits.

01:34:23.241 --> 01:34:24.325
You'll look great.

01:34:24.409 --> 01:34:26.910
Those are nice. She won't see me.

01:34:29.456 --> 01:34:31.665
Have you tried to call her?

01:34:33.460 --> 01:34:38.255
Why don't you call her right now?

01:34:38.548 --> 01:34:40.049
Dad, just call her.

01:34:40.133 --> 01:34:41.675
Call her for me.

01:34:41.926 --> 01:34:45.637
Tell her I have two first-class tickets
to go see her son's wedding...

01:34:45.722 --> 01:34:47.598
You mother's married now
to my friend, Jack Barnes.

01:34:47.682 --> 01:34:50.434
They have a house in Long Island.

01:34:51.603 --> 01:34:54.271
I had an F.B.I. agent come see me.

01:34:55.523 --> 01:34:58.817
You got their number, son.
The guy looked scared.

01:34:59.361 --> 01:35:03.155
The United States Government, champ,
running for the hills.

01:35:04.199 --> 01:35:05.574
Pow! To the moon!

01:35:17.045 --> 01:35:18.045
Dad.

01:35:19.214 --> 01:35:20.631
It's over.

01:35:21.800 --> 01:35:23.175
I'm going to stop now.

01:35:26.346 --> 01:35:28.138
They're never gonna catch you, Frank.

01:35:28.223 --> 01:35:31.683
She wouldn't do that!
Why would she do that to you?

01:35:31.851 --> 01:35:34.770
Come on. Sit with me. Have a drink.
I'm your father.

01:35:36.231 --> 01:35:40.442
Then ask me to stop.
Then ask me to stop.

01:35:43.780 --> 01:35:45.364
You can't stop.

01:35:47.951 --> 01:35:49.952
Where are you going?

01:35:50.036 --> 01:35:52.371
Come on, Frank, where are you going?

01:35:52.497 --> 01:35:55.082
Where are you going?
Where are you going tonight?

01:35:55.417 --> 01:35:56.792
Someplace exotic?

01:35:56.876 --> 01:35:59.503
Where are you going tonight?
Tahiti? Hawaii?

01:36:16.896 --> 01:36:18.605
This is Hanratty.

01:36:19.899 --> 01:36:21.400
Hello, Carl.

01:36:21.985 --> 01:36:23.485
Merry Christmas.

01:36:23.987 --> 01:36:25.863
How are you, Dr. Conners?

01:36:26.364 --> 01:36:29.491
Carl, I haven't been Dr. Conners
for months now.

01:36:32.912 --> 01:36:34.121
Well,

01:36:34.414 --> 01:36:37.166
I'm sitting here in my office
on Christmas Eve.

01:36:38.001 --> 01:36:39.626
What do you want?

01:36:45.133 --> 01:36:46.341
Okay.

01:36:50.889 --> 01:36:52.764
I want it to be over.

01:36:57.395 --> 01:37:00.230
I want it to be over. I'm getting married.

01:37:00.773 --> 01:37:02.399
I'm settling down.

01:37:02.484 --> 01:37:04.735
You've stolen almost $4 million.

01:37:04.986 --> 01:37:07.279
You think we could call it
a wedding present?

01:37:07.363 --> 01:37:09.656
This isn't something
you get to walk away from, Frank.

01:37:09.741 --> 01:37:12.117
- I want to call a truce.
- No truce.

01:37:12.202 --> 01:37:15.829
You will be caught, you will go to prison.
Where did you think this was going?

01:37:16.372 --> 01:37:18.707
Please leave me alone, Carl.

01:37:19.334 --> 01:37:20.584
Please?

01:37:21.169 --> 01:37:23.253
I'm getting close, aren't I?

01:37:23.338 --> 01:37:25.964
You're scared because
I'm getting close. I know

01:37:26.049 --> 01:37:30.260
you rented a car in Shreveport,
stayed in a hotel on Lake Charles.

01:37:31.262 --> 01:37:33.138
You want to run, be my guest.

01:37:33.223 --> 01:37:35.849
Your checks don't lie as well as you do.

01:37:35.934 --> 01:37:37.601
Stop chasing me.

01:37:40.772 --> 01:37:42.272
I can't stop.

01:37:43.608 --> 01:37:44.983
It's my job.

01:37:46.236 --> 01:37:47.945
It's okay, Carl.

01:37:50.114 --> 01:37:52.157
I just thought I'd ask.

01:37:54.494 --> 01:37:55.494
Hey.

01:37:56.746 --> 01:37:58.247
Merry Christmas.

01:38:01.793 --> 01:38:03.377
I love my job.

01:38:04.796 --> 01:38:06.171
All right.

01:38:06.381 --> 01:38:09.800
Let's get every newspaper in Louisiana
for the last two months.

01:38:09.884 --> 01:38:11.343
What're we looking for?

01:38:11.427 --> 01:38:13.971
Engagement announcements.
Name of Conners.

01:38:14.556 --> 01:38:17.558
Come on, the kid
would have changed his name by now.

01:38:17.642 --> 01:38:20.310
Uh-uh. He can't change it.

01:38:20.687 --> 01:38:22.354
She thinks he's Conners.

01:38:22.438 --> 01:38:24.940
If he loses the name, he loses the girl.

01:38:35.159 --> 01:38:37.786
- Congratulations!
- Having a good time?

01:38:42.166 --> 01:38:43.667
Keep dancing.

01:38:46.504 --> 01:38:48.171
Look who's here.

01:38:49.674 --> 01:38:51.967
I'm going to the little boys' room.

01:38:52.552 --> 01:38:53.969
Hurry back.

01:39:09.360 --> 01:39:12.362
Good evening.
I'm Agent Hanratty with the F.B.I.

01:39:12.447 --> 01:39:14.781
We'd like to have a few kind words
with your host, if possible.

01:39:14.866 --> 01:39:16.158
I'll get him.

01:39:18.620 --> 01:39:20.537
Right over there, sir.

01:39:22.790 --> 01:39:24.708
Good evening, gentlemen.
I'm Roger Strong.

01:39:24.792 --> 01:39:28.295
Carl Hanratty, F.B.I.
These are Agents Amdursky and Fox.

01:39:29.339 --> 01:39:32.883
- Sorry to crash your party, sir.
- Not at all. What can I do for you?

01:39:32.967 --> 01:39:36.345
If it's not too much trouble,
I'd like to meet the groom.

01:39:36.429 --> 01:39:38.221
Is there a problem?

01:39:40.808 --> 01:39:43.393
Frank! Can you hold all these?

01:39:43.478 --> 01:39:45.437
They're checks.
They're from my dad's friends.

01:39:45.521 --> 01:39:47.814
They're for us so
we can start our new life...

01:39:47.899 --> 01:39:50.484
What are you doing? What's wrong?

01:39:50.610 --> 01:39:52.361
We have to leave.

01:39:55.198 --> 01:39:56.698
You love me, right?

01:39:56.908 --> 01:39:59.242
I mean, you'd love me no matter what.

01:39:59.410 --> 01:40:03.246
You'd love me whether I was sick
or poor, or if I had a different name.

01:40:03.331 --> 01:40:04.790
Frank, where did you get
all that money?

01:40:04.916 --> 01:40:08.126
Brenda, listen. A name doesn't matter.

01:40:08.211 --> 01:40:09.544
My name is Frank Conners.

01:40:09.629 --> 01:40:12.255
That's who I am with you.
But we all have secrets.

01:40:12.340 --> 01:40:14.549
Sometimes when I travel,
I use the name Frank Taylor.

01:40:14.634 --> 01:40:16.301
That's my secret.

01:40:16.386 --> 01:40:20.263
Frank Taylor, you know.
Frank Black. It doesn't matter.

01:40:20.890 --> 01:40:22.474
Why are you saying all this?

01:40:24.060 --> 01:40:26.561
Brenda, I don't want to lie
to you anymore.

01:40:26.646 --> 01:40:28.980
I'm not a doctor,
I never went to medical school.

01:40:29.065 --> 01:40:32.359
I'm not a lawyer, or a Harvard graduate
or a Lutheran.

01:40:32.443 --> 01:40:36.196
I ran away from home
a year and a half ago when I was 16.

01:40:39.325 --> 01:40:40.325
Frank.

01:40:41.703 --> 01:40:43.620
You're not a Lutheran?

01:40:44.789 --> 01:40:47.624
You see all this money? I have more.

01:40:48.167 --> 01:40:50.001
I have plenty more.

01:40:50.795 --> 01:40:54.464
I have enough money to last us
for the rest of our lives. Look.

01:40:55.383 --> 01:40:57.300
Frank, stop teasing me!

01:40:57.677 --> 01:41:01.096
You're Frank Conners
and you're 28 years old...

01:41:03.307 --> 01:41:05.142
Why would you lie to me?

01:41:05.351 --> 01:41:06.351
Brenda.

01:41:06.602 --> 01:41:09.396
I want to know your name.
Tell me your name.

01:41:09.480 --> 01:41:12.858
We can live anywhere we want.
But you have to trust me.

01:41:12.942 --> 01:41:15.777
Do you trust me?
Do you love me, Brenda?

01:41:15.862 --> 01:41:17.320
Yes. I love you.

01:41:18.030 --> 01:41:19.614
Excuse me, Mother.

01:41:20.241 --> 01:41:22.951
This is Mr. Hanratty. My wife, Carol.

01:41:23.035 --> 01:41:24.995
- Mister...
- Hanratty, ma'am.

01:41:25.288 --> 01:41:27.122
Have you seen Frank or Brenda?

01:41:27.206 --> 01:41:29.166
I think they went upstairs.

01:41:38.885 --> 01:41:40.051
Come here.

01:41:40.720 --> 01:41:44.347
In two days,
meet me at Miami International Airport.

01:41:44.432 --> 01:41:48.101
Leave the house after your parents
go to sleep. Take a taxicab.

01:41:48.186 --> 01:41:51.813
Give the taxi driver this money.
Tell him to drive all through the night.

01:41:51.898 --> 01:41:53.774
You're gonna leave at 10:00 a.m.

01:41:53.858 --> 01:41:55.317
10:00 a.m. All right?

01:42:15.004 --> 01:42:17.214
- Which room, sir?
- In the corner.

01:42:17.715 --> 01:42:21.885
You have to listen. The International
Terminal in Miami. Say it.

01:42:22.011 --> 01:42:26.139
No matter what, take a taxicab,
be there at 10:00 a.m.

01:42:26.224 --> 01:42:28.016
I'll be there at 10:00 a.m.
no matter what.

01:42:28.100 --> 01:42:30.644
In two days. Two days, Brenda.
Two days.

01:42:30.728 --> 01:42:33.605
In two days I'll be there,
no matter what, at 10:00 a.m.

01:42:40.655 --> 01:42:43.490
We're not gonna tell anyone, Brenda.
You have to promise me now.

01:42:43.574 --> 01:42:48.703
Please! Before you go,
please tell me your name. Tell me.

01:42:50.164 --> 01:42:53.792
Frank William Abagnale, Jr.

01:45:06.592 --> 01:45:07.842
Brenda.

01:45:20.856 --> 01:45:22.899
- This guy is a no-show.
- Maybe he was tipped.

01:45:23.192 --> 01:45:24.734
He's not here today, it'll be tomorrow.

01:45:24.819 --> 01:45:26.486
We'll get him before
he leaves the country.

01:45:26.570 --> 01:45:28.363
He doesn't have a passport.

01:45:28.447 --> 01:45:30.490
For the last six months,
he's gone to Harvard and Berkeley.

01:45:30.574 --> 01:45:32.617
I'm betting he can get a passport.

01:45:32.702 --> 01:45:35.036
Our men are waiting for him here
in Miami International.

01:45:35.121 --> 01:45:36.746
He's used it before,
he knows the layout.

01:45:36.831 --> 01:45:40.291
The Miami police offered us
50 uniformed cops in two shifts of 25.

01:45:40.376 --> 01:45:42.752
With our guys,
that's almost 100 men in one airport.

01:45:42.837 --> 01:45:44.295
Don't you think we should
spread it around?

01:45:44.380 --> 01:45:45.880
No, this is the exit point.

01:45:45.965 --> 01:45:47.507
How do you know he hasn't rented a car

01:45:47.591 --> 01:45:49.968
and driven to airports
in New York, Atlanta?

01:45:50.052 --> 01:45:53.096
Because I'm not in New York.
I'm not in Atlanta.

01:45:53.389 --> 01:45:55.682
Yes. This is Frank Roberts.

01:45:55.766 --> 01:45:58.268
I'm letting all the universities
in the area know

01:45:58.352 --> 01:46:02.105
that Pan Am will be initiating
a new recruiting program this year.

01:46:02.189 --> 01:46:05.442
I'll be stopping by
your campus tomorrow morning.

01:46:05.943 --> 01:46:08.153
Thank you all very much for coming.

01:46:08.654 --> 01:46:12.073
At the end of the day,
I'll be choosing eight young ladies

01:46:12.158 --> 01:46:13.575
to be a part of.

01:46:14.326 --> 01:46:18.163
Pan Am's future stewardess
flight crew program.

01:46:18.247 --> 01:46:20.373
These eight young ladies
will accompany me on

01:46:20.458 --> 01:46:23.334
a two-month public relations tour
through Europe

01:46:24.420 --> 01:46:27.130
where they will discover firsthand
what it takes

01:46:27.214 --> 01:46:29.257
to be a Pan American stewardess.

01:46:32.344 --> 01:46:36.389
Give me at least two men, no,
one man per every two counters.

01:46:38.642 --> 01:46:39.684
Amdursky?

01:46:41.312 --> 01:46:45.398
Make sure your uniforms are covering
the sidewalks, entrances and exits.

01:46:47.568 --> 01:46:50.403
Let's have periodic sweeps
of the men's lav.

01:46:52.114 --> 01:46:55.116
What qualifies me
to be a future stewardess?

01:46:55.367 --> 01:47:00.121
Well, I think that I'm really friendly
and I can really help out

01:47:00.206 --> 01:47:03.208
and make people feel welcome
on the plane and...

01:47:03.292 --> 01:47:05.502
We'll be traveling
at 6,000 miles per hour,

01:47:05.586 --> 01:47:07.545
at an altitude of 300 feet.

01:47:07.671 --> 01:47:09.964
All my bags are packed

01:47:10.800 --> 01:47:12.383
I'm ready to go

01:47:14.762 --> 01:47:16.346
llene Anderson.

01:47:24.563 --> 01:47:26.022
Miggy Acker.

01:47:30.820 --> 01:47:32.570
Debra Jo McMillan.

01:47:39.620 --> 01:47:41.037
Candy Heston.

01:48:40.556 --> 01:48:43.641
- Did you see that blonde out front?
- I should have been a pilot.

01:48:43.726 --> 01:48:44.726
Exactly.

01:48:44.810 --> 01:48:47.687
Mr. Hanratty,
pick up the courtesy telephone.

01:48:47.771 --> 01:48:48.813
Hanratty.

01:48:48.898 --> 01:48:50.190
Your walkie-talkie
wasn't working.

01:48:50.274 --> 01:48:51.941
There's a guy in a Pan Am uniform

01:48:52.026 --> 01:48:54.861
sitting in a white Coupe DeVille
in front of Terminal J.

01:48:54.945 --> 01:48:58.156
That's the charter terminal.
Did you get a look at his face?

01:48:58.240 --> 01:49:01.367
He's got his pilot's cap on.
Carl, I think it's him.

01:49:13.547 --> 01:49:15.173
Out of the car, Frank.

01:49:15.799 --> 01:49:17.008
Frank?

01:49:17.218 --> 01:49:19.052
Step out of the car.

01:49:19.303 --> 01:49:21.262
Keep your hands where I can see them.

01:49:21.347 --> 01:49:23.223
Don't shoot me. I'm just a driver.

01:49:23.307 --> 01:49:25.141
A man paid me $100
to wear this uniform

01:49:25.226 --> 01:49:28.436
- to pick someone up at the airport.
- Who're you picking up?

01:49:28.520 --> 01:49:29.646
Hey!

01:49:54.296 --> 01:49:57.298
South America, Australia,
Singapore, Egypt.

01:49:57.383 --> 01:49:59.509
The kid's gone completely
out of control.

01:49:59.593 --> 01:50:01.928
- Why wasn't I called?
- Nobody was called, sir.

01:50:02.012 --> 01:50:03.805
The banks didn't know
what was happening until last week.

01:50:03.889 --> 01:50:04.931
That's impossible.

01:50:05.015 --> 01:50:07.267
They didn't call because it's not
counterfeiting. It's something else.

01:50:07.351 --> 01:50:09.978
- What is he doing?
- He's making real checks, sir.

01:50:10.062 --> 01:50:11.938
These are so perfect,
the airline didn't know the difference.

01:50:12.022 --> 01:50:13.898
Last check was cashed in Madrid
a week ago.

01:50:13.983 --> 01:50:16.776
My guess is he's still there.
We've to leave now, sir. Today.

01:50:16.860 --> 01:50:19.529
For where? Spain?
You want to go to Spain?

01:50:19.613 --> 01:50:21.906
Eventually, he's gotta go back
to where the checks were printed.

01:50:21.991 --> 01:50:23.366
I think that's why he's moving back
through Europe.

01:50:23.450 --> 01:50:24.867
Look at the map, sir.
He's making a circle.

01:50:24.952 --> 01:50:26.661
He's running out of checks.

01:50:26.745 --> 01:50:31.207
It's a long shot, but if we could track him
from Madrid, we could still catch him.

01:50:31.292 --> 01:50:34.294
I'm sorry, Carl. If you couldn't catch him
here, you're not gonna catch him there.

01:50:34.378 --> 01:50:36.212
We're going to let him get away.

01:50:37.381 --> 01:50:39.757
No, Carl, you let him get away.

01:51:21.633 --> 01:51:24.260
A perfect one-sixteenth

01:51:24.636 --> 01:51:26.429
all the way around.

01:51:28.724 --> 01:51:31.017
Color separation is flawless.

01:51:33.771 --> 01:51:35.313
There's no bleeding.

01:51:35.439 --> 01:51:38.149
Nobody does work like this
in the States.

01:51:38.233 --> 01:51:39.692
Nobody but us.

01:51:39.777 --> 01:51:41.486
Where was it printed?

01:51:41.570 --> 01:51:44.364
- It was printed on a monster.
- A monster.

01:51:44.448 --> 01:51:46.824
- A Heidelberg, an Istra.
- Heidelberg.

01:51:46.909 --> 01:51:50.244
A dinosaur, four colors,
you can smell the weight.

01:51:50.496 --> 01:51:52.663
Two tons, without the ink.

01:51:53.207 --> 01:51:55.625
Where do they do printing like this?

01:51:55.709 --> 01:51:57.335
Germany, Great Britain.

01:51:57.419 --> 01:51:58.669
France.

01:52:01.090 --> 01:52:03.508
France. Frank's mother said the name
of a village in France,

01:52:03.592 --> 01:52:04.884
where they didn't have Sara Lee.

01:52:04.968 --> 01:52:06.677
The village where
she met Frank's father.

01:52:06.762 --> 01:52:07.887
I don't remember.

01:52:07.971 --> 01:52:11.808
It started with an "M."
It was "Mont" something. Mr. Fox?

01:52:11.892 --> 01:52:14.352
Yes. Question,
"You met your husband during the war?"

01:52:14.436 --> 01:52:16.437
Answer, "I lived in a very small village
in France",

01:52:16.522 --> 01:52:17.980
"the kind of place
where they never heard of Sara Lee."

01:52:18.065 --> 01:52:21.025
Tell me you wrote down
the name of the village, Mr. Fox.

01:52:22.611 --> 01:52:24.028
Montrichard.

01:53:20.878 --> 01:53:22.044
Carl?

01:53:24.715 --> 01:53:26.382
Merry Christmas!

01:53:26.508 --> 01:53:29.469
How is it that we're always talking
on Christmas?

01:53:29.553 --> 01:53:31.762
Every Christmas, I'm talking to you!

01:53:31.847 --> 01:53:34.432
Put your shirt on, Frank.
You're under arrest.

01:53:34.516 --> 01:53:36.642
Are you hungry?
Do you want some beans?

01:53:36.727 --> 01:53:38.644
Carl, they got
the best French beans here.

01:53:38.729 --> 01:53:42.482
There's two dozen
French police officers outside.

01:53:42.566 --> 01:53:43.983
They wanted to bring you in,

01:53:44.067 --> 01:53:46.402
but they needed the help
of an American.

01:53:46.487 --> 01:53:47.987
But I told them
I wouldn't bring them to you,

01:53:48.071 --> 01:53:50.072
unless I could put the cuffs
on you myself.

01:53:50.199 --> 01:53:52.825
You have a gun? Do you have a gun?
No gun?

01:53:52.910 --> 01:53:53.910
- No.
- No gun.

01:53:55.871 --> 01:53:58.039
And you're telling me what?

01:53:59.249 --> 01:54:01.209
There's two dozen
French police officers

01:54:01.293 --> 01:54:02.793
out there right now on Christmas Eve?

01:54:02.878 --> 01:54:05.087
- That's what you're telling me?
- Yeah.

01:54:05.172 --> 01:54:07.757
All right. There's no windows here.

01:54:08.342 --> 01:54:09.842
I'm going to take a look
out the front door.

01:54:09.927 --> 01:54:10.927
No!

01:54:11.011 --> 01:54:15.014
I told them I'd walk out first
and give a signal. Put these on yourself.

01:54:15.098 --> 01:54:17.767
No, I can't do that! You know why?

01:54:19.269 --> 01:54:20.853
Because I think you're full of shit.

01:54:20.938 --> 01:54:23.523
I don't think there's anyone else
out there.

01:54:23.607 --> 01:54:26.442
I think it's just me and you. That's right.

01:54:26.527 --> 01:54:28.319
It's just me and you,
and you know what?

01:54:28.987 --> 01:54:30.947
You're gonna have to catch me yourself.

01:54:31.031 --> 01:54:33.991
- We don't have time for this.
- That's good.

01:54:34.910 --> 01:54:37.328
Tell me what you want me to see.

01:54:37.871 --> 01:54:41.541
- I wouldn't lie to you.
- You're wearing a wedding ring.

01:54:41.625 --> 01:54:44.252
You lied to me about that!
Did you lie about that?

01:54:44.336 --> 01:54:48.172
You asked me if I had a family.
I did. But I don't anymore.

01:54:56.848 --> 01:55:00.768
Yes. No, there is no problem.
We're coming out right now.

01:55:03.188 --> 01:55:04.730
That was good.

01:55:05.274 --> 01:55:07.400
Did you pay some hotel desk clerk
to make that call for you?

01:55:07.484 --> 01:55:08.526
Is that what you did?

01:55:08.610 --> 01:55:11.779
It was Captain Luc.
I've got one minute to bring you out.

01:55:11.863 --> 01:55:14.282
Captain Luc? Oh, Captain Luc! Well,

01:55:14.366 --> 01:55:18.244
that sounds pretty official to me,
but, like I said,

01:55:18.328 --> 01:55:22.290
I think it's just me and you here.
So you'll have to catch me.

01:55:22.374 --> 01:55:24.875
Frank, you have to trust me on this.

01:55:24.960 --> 01:55:28.087
These people have been embarrassed.
They're angry.

01:55:28.171 --> 01:55:30.631
You rob their banks, you steal
their money, you live in their country.

01:55:30.716 --> 01:55:32.967
I told you this was
what was going to happen.

01:55:33.051 --> 01:55:34.760
That there was no other way
for it to end.

01:55:36.054 --> 01:55:37.930
Don't make a mistake.

01:55:38.140 --> 01:55:40.391
That's good, Carl, you know?

01:55:41.018 --> 01:55:43.769
Keep pushing that lie. Keep pushing it.

01:55:43.854 --> 01:55:47.481
- Keep pushing till you make it true.
- They'll kill you.

01:55:47.816 --> 01:55:50.026
You walk out that door,
they're gonna kill you.

01:55:55.282 --> 01:55:57.033
Is that the truth?

01:56:01.079 --> 01:56:02.246
Yeah.

01:56:08.003 --> 01:56:09.545
Do you have any children, Carl?

01:56:10.964 --> 01:56:13.382
I have a 4-year-old daughter.

01:56:14.217 --> 01:56:16.552
Do you swear on your daughter?

01:56:18.722 --> 01:56:20.722
You swear?

01:56:58.804 --> 01:57:00.971
That was really good, Carl.

01:57:08.689 --> 01:57:10.022
I have him in custody.

01:57:11.483 --> 01:57:13.609
I got him! It's all right.

01:57:15.612 --> 01:57:17.488
It's all right. I got him.

01:57:21.201 --> 01:57:23.244
I want it on the record.

01:57:23.870 --> 01:57:27.581
Frank Abagnale surrendered
of his own accord. Understood?

01:57:28.750 --> 01:57:31.419
Where are you taking him?
I'm supposed to go.

01:57:33.338 --> 01:57:35.923
Let me in the car!

01:57:41.680 --> 01:57:45.433
Don't worry. I'll have you extradited back
to the United States.

01:58:06.747 --> 01:58:07.830
Carl.

01:58:11.501 --> 01:58:15.254
You have to remember
to let me call my father when we land.

01:58:15.338 --> 01:58:20.092
I want to talk to him before he sees me
on television or something like that.

01:58:30.395 --> 01:58:31.812
Carl, look.

01:58:32.147 --> 01:58:34.148
That's LaGuardia right there.

01:58:34.232 --> 01:58:35.608
Runway 44.

01:58:35.734 --> 01:58:37.902
Frank, your father is dead.

01:58:38.737 --> 01:58:40.112
I'm sorry.

01:58:41.031 --> 01:58:44.825
I didn't want to say anything
until we got closer to home.

01:58:45.660 --> 01:58:46.952
He fell down some steps

01:58:47.037 --> 01:58:50.289
at Grand Central Station
trying to catch a train.

01:58:50.832 --> 01:58:52.875
I didn't want to be the one to tell you.

01:58:53.877 --> 01:58:55.711
You're lying, right?

01:58:57.506 --> 01:58:59.799
You said I could talk to him.

01:58:59.925 --> 01:59:02.718
Who are you to say something like that?

01:59:03.637 --> 01:59:05.888
- You said I could talk to him.
- He fell

01:59:05.972 --> 01:59:08.474
and he broke his neck. I'm sorry.

01:59:09.643 --> 01:59:11.352
I'm really sorry.

01:59:22.405 --> 01:59:23.823
God damn it!

01:59:25.826 --> 01:59:27.701
I'm going to be sick.

01:59:28.119 --> 01:59:29.954
It's all right. It's okay.

01:59:30.038 --> 01:59:33.666
- I'm going to be sick!
- Sure. Let's go to the bathroom.

01:59:40.590 --> 01:59:42.007
God damn it!

02:00:01.736 --> 02:00:02.945
Daddy.

02:00:05.574 --> 02:00:06.824
You'll have to take your seat, sir.

02:00:06.908 --> 02:00:09.493
I've told you twice.
We're landing. All of you.

02:00:09.578 --> 02:00:11.370
Frank! Come on now.

02:00:11.621 --> 02:00:14.498
We're landing in six minutes.
You need to be in your seats...

02:00:14.583 --> 02:00:17.001
- Open the door!
- ...with seat belts fastened.

02:00:17.335 --> 02:00:18.627
Frank!

02:00:20.255 --> 02:00:21.589
You do it.

02:00:51.161 --> 02:00:52.369
Frank!

02:00:58.335 --> 02:01:01.295
All right,
remain seated everyone, please.

02:01:10.430 --> 02:01:12.348
Please remain seated.

02:01:15.268 --> 02:01:16.769
God Almighty.

02:02:06.486 --> 02:02:08.195
What's your name?

02:02:12.200 --> 02:02:13.575
Where's your mommy?

02:02:38.893 --> 02:02:40.644
Sarge, we're good.

02:02:50.739 --> 02:02:51.822
Hold up!

02:02:55.452 --> 02:02:57.828
Put your hands behind your head!

02:02:57.912 --> 02:02:59.079
Carl.

02:02:59.289 --> 02:03:01.415
Get me in the car, please.

02:03:04.127 --> 02:03:05.544
Put him in.

02:03:22.479 --> 02:03:25.814
Taking into account
the gravity of these crimes,

02:03:25.982 --> 02:03:29.068
your history of bold
and elusive behavior

02:03:29.402 --> 02:03:33.322
and your complete lack of respect
for the laws of the United States,

02:03:33.907 --> 02:03:38.327
I have no choice but to ignore
your request to be treated as a minor,

02:03:38.870 --> 02:03:43.499
and sentence you to 12 years
in Atlanta's maximum security prison

02:03:44.125 --> 02:03:47.753
and recommend strongly
that you be kept in isolation

02:03:47.921 --> 02:03:50.464
for the entirety of that sentence.

02:04:32.549 --> 02:04:34.174
Merry Christmas, Frank.

02:04:37.220 --> 02:04:39.388
I got you some comic books.

02:04:46.312 --> 02:04:48.730
How's your daughter?
What was her name?

02:04:49.107 --> 02:04:50.315
Grace.

02:04:52.026 --> 02:04:55.154
I don't know. She lives with her mother
in Chicago, I don't get to see her much.

02:04:57.240 --> 02:04:59.283
What's in the briefcase?

02:05:00.285 --> 02:05:02.578
I'm on my way to the airport.

02:05:02.871 --> 02:05:04.997
It's a paperhanger
working his way through Minnesota.

02:05:07.125 --> 02:05:09.418
Jesus. He's driving us crazy.

02:05:09.711 --> 02:05:11.170
You got any of the checks?

02:05:11.504 --> 02:05:14.131
Yeah, I got a counterfeit he drew

02:05:14.424 --> 02:05:16.675
in Great Lakes Savings and Loan.

02:05:16.759 --> 02:05:19.803
He's using a stencil machine
and an Underwood.

02:05:20.263 --> 02:05:21.847
It's a teller at the bank.

02:05:22.265 --> 02:05:23.557
Say again?

02:05:23.641 --> 02:05:25.350
It's definitely a teller, Carl.

02:05:25.435 --> 02:05:28.353
Banks always use hand stamps
for the dates.

02:05:28.438 --> 02:05:31.607
They get used over and over again,
so they always get worn out.

02:05:31.691 --> 02:05:35.235
And the numbers are always cracking.
The sixes and the nines,

02:05:35.320 --> 02:05:37.112
see, they go first.

02:05:39.532 --> 02:05:40.782
Thanks.

02:05:46.873 --> 02:05:49.708
I'd like you to take a look
at something for me.

02:05:53.963 --> 02:05:55.964
Tell me what you think.

02:05:59.469 --> 02:06:01.011
That's a fake.

02:06:01.137 --> 02:06:02.471
How do you know,
you haven't looked at it?

02:06:02.555 --> 02:06:04.681
There's no perforated edge, right?

02:06:04.807 --> 02:06:07.726
I mean, this check was hand-cut,
not fed.

02:06:09.062 --> 02:06:10.270
Yeah.

02:06:10.355 --> 02:06:14.149
Paper is double-bonded,
much too heavy to be a bank check.

02:06:15.318 --> 02:06:19.279
Magnetic ink, it's raised against
my fingers instead of flat.

02:06:21.032 --> 02:06:25.327
And this doesn't smell like MICR,
it's some kind of a drafting ink.

02:06:25.411 --> 02:06:28.205
The kind you get at a stationery store.

02:06:33.503 --> 02:06:34.753
Frank,

02:06:35.505 --> 02:06:40.092
would you be interested in working
with the F.B.I.'s Financial Crimes Unit?

02:06:40.426 --> 02:06:43.845
I already got a job here, you know.
I deliver the mail.

02:06:46.391 --> 02:06:49.810
Frank, we have the power
to take you out of prison.

02:06:50.979 --> 02:06:53.438
You'll be placed in the custody
of the F.B.I. where you'd serve out

02:06:53.523 --> 02:06:54.606
the remainder of your sentence

02:06:54.691 --> 02:06:56.233
as an employee
of the Federal Government.

02:06:59.195 --> 02:07:01.029
Under whose custody?

02:07:09.872 --> 02:07:11.081
Hi.

02:07:11.207 --> 02:07:14.876
I'm Frank Abagnale.
I'm supposed to start work here today.

02:07:14.961 --> 02:07:18.088
It's a tour company
operating out of the BVI.

02:07:18.298 --> 02:07:19.965
Sir, Mr. Abagnale is here.

02:07:20.049 --> 02:07:22.092
I'm gonna call you back.

02:07:52.081 --> 02:07:54.791
- Hello, Carl.
- Welcome to the F.B.I.

02:07:55.418 --> 02:07:57.961
I'll show you where you're working.

02:08:06.929 --> 02:08:09.348
How long do I have to work here?

02:08:09.474 --> 02:08:12.059
It's 8:15 in the morning
to 5:00 in the afternoon,

02:08:12.143 --> 02:08:14.102
45 minutes for lunch.

02:08:15.938 --> 02:08:17.689
No. I mean, how long?

02:08:19.359 --> 02:08:20.776
Every day.

02:08:21.277 --> 02:08:23.528
Every day, Frank, till we let you go.

02:09:17.417 --> 02:09:18.750
Hey, Carl.

02:09:21.337 --> 02:09:22.587
How are you doing?

02:09:22.672 --> 02:09:26.508
It's not a good time, Frank.
I'm clearing my desk for the weekend.

02:09:29.512 --> 02:09:32.222
You mind
if I come to work with you tomorrow?

02:09:32.348 --> 02:09:34.182
Tomorrow is Saturday.

02:09:34.267 --> 02:09:36.143
I'm flying to Chicago
to see my daughter.

02:09:36.227 --> 02:09:37.561
I'll be back to work on Monday.

02:09:37.687 --> 02:09:41.064
- You're going to see Grace?
- Yeah, that's the plan.

02:09:44.735 --> 02:09:46.778
What should I do till Monday?

02:09:46.863 --> 02:09:50.198
I'm sorry, kid, I can't help you there.
Excuse me.

02:09:56.539 --> 02:09:58.248
This is Hanratty.

02:09:58.958 --> 02:10:00.709
Yeah, put him on.

02:10:08.885 --> 02:10:10.260
Mr. Sawyer.

02:10:10.970 --> 02:10:12.429
How are you?

02:10:12.722 --> 02:10:16.600
I have half a dozen more checks
on that tour operator at the BVI.

02:10:56.933 --> 02:10:58.934
How did you do it, Frank?

02:11:00.770 --> 02:11:03.438
How did you pass the bar in Louisiana?

02:11:03.523 --> 02:11:05.607
What are you doing here?

02:11:06.275 --> 02:11:07.484
Listen.

02:11:08.194 --> 02:11:10.111
I'm sorry I put you through all this.

02:11:10.196 --> 02:11:12.989
You go back to Europe,
you'll die in Perpignan Prison.

02:11:13.074 --> 02:11:14.032
You try to run here in the States,

02:11:14.116 --> 02:11:17.452
we'll send you back to Atlanta
for 50 years.

02:11:17.537 --> 02:11:18.995
I know that.

02:11:20.665 --> 02:11:23.166
I spent four years
trying to arrange your release.

02:11:23.292 --> 02:11:25.085
I had to convince my bosses
at the F.B.I.

02:11:25.169 --> 02:11:28.046
and the Attorney General
of the United States you wouldn't run.

02:11:28.548 --> 02:11:30.298
Why did you do it?

02:11:31.008 --> 02:11:33.718
- You're just a kid.
- I'm not your kid.

02:11:34.136 --> 02:11:36.513
You said you were going to Chicago.

02:11:36.681 --> 02:11:40.475
My daughter can't see me this weekend.
She's going skiing.

02:11:41.018 --> 02:11:43.311
You said she was four years old.
You're lying.

02:11:43.396 --> 02:11:46.189
She was four when I left. Now she's 15.

02:11:46.691 --> 02:11:49.568
My wife has been remarried
for 11 years.

02:11:49.652 --> 02:11:52.070
I see Grace every now and again.

02:11:52.822 --> 02:11:55.323
- I don't understand.
- Sure you do.

02:11:56.158 --> 02:11:58.868
Sometimes it's easier living the lie.

02:12:02.164 --> 02:12:04.499
I'm gonna let you fly tonight, Frank.

02:12:05.334 --> 02:12:09.504
I won't even try to stop you, because
I know you'll be back on Monday.

02:12:09.589 --> 02:12:10.755
Yeah.

02:12:11.257 --> 02:12:13.675
How do you know I'll come back?

02:12:16.053 --> 02:12:17.178
Look.

02:12:18.222 --> 02:12:19.389
Frank.

02:12:19.724 --> 02:12:21.683
Nobody is chasing you.

02:12:42.121 --> 02:12:44.539
Alice, has he still not called?

02:12:44.624 --> 02:12:46.207
No, he hasn't.

02:12:57.720 --> 02:12:59.012
Good morning.

02:12:59.096 --> 02:13:01.139
I've called this meeting to discuss

02:13:01.223 --> 02:13:03.558
a new type of check fraud
and counterfeiting.

02:13:03.643 --> 02:13:05.852
The unsub is washing
and altering checks,

02:13:05.936 --> 02:13:07.520
then passing them throughout Arizona.

02:13:12.234 --> 02:13:16.363
This unsub is a big dog,
passing checks as large as five figures.

02:13:19.784 --> 02:13:21.409
Sorry I'm late.

02:13:22.703 --> 02:13:23.912
Sorry.

02:13:28.125 --> 02:13:31.002
We have a recovered check
on Agent Reiter's desk.

02:13:31.087 --> 02:13:33.797
Why don't we step out to the bullpen?

02:13:38.219 --> 02:13:40.762
There's impressions on every line.

02:13:42.431 --> 02:13:45.433
Looks like the original amount
was for $60.

02:13:48.979 --> 02:13:50.897
Mind if I take a look?

02:13:53.984 --> 02:13:56.403
Cashed in Flagstaff a week ago.

02:13:59.156 --> 02:14:01.241
Cost the bank $16,000.

02:14:02.910 --> 02:14:04.953
- It's a real check.
- Yeah.

02:14:05.621 --> 02:14:09.040
It's been washed.
The only thing original is the signature.

02:14:09.125 --> 02:14:10.834
But it's perfect.

02:14:11.252 --> 02:14:14.170
I mean, this isn't hydrochloride
or bleach.

02:14:14.338 --> 02:14:15.463
No.

02:14:15.589 --> 02:14:17.132
Something new.

02:14:17.299 --> 02:14:22.303
A nail polish remover where the acetone
removes the ink that's not been printed?

02:14:25.433 --> 02:14:27.225
How did you do it, Frank?

02:14:28.644 --> 02:14:31.813
How did you cheat on the bar exam
in Louisiana?

02:14:36.986 --> 02:14:38.611
I didn't cheat.

02:14:40.156 --> 02:14:42.866
I studied for two weeks and I passed.

02:14:44.994 --> 02:14:48.705
Is that the truth?

02:14:48.789 --> 02:14:51.958
I'll bet this guy steals checks
out of mailboxes.

02:14:52.042 --> 02:14:55.170
He washes off their names
and puts on his own.

02:14:56.630 --> 02:14:58.757
You're saying he's a local?

02:14:58.841 --> 02:15:02.594
If it were me, I'd call the bank first.
Check out the balance...

02:15:02.678 --> 02:15:04.971
Make sure there's enough money
in there to make it worth your while.

02:15:05.055 --> 02:15:06.181
Exactly.

02:15:06.515 --> 02:15:09.517
You know, Carl, I think
this guy is pretty smart.

02:15:10.019 --> 02:15:12.395
Guess all we have to do now
is catch him.
